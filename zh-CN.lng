AccessibilityTTSHint=When enabled, all on-screen text will be read with the NVDA screen reader, or alternatively an MS SAPI compatible voice. Recommended for blind players. If you are using NVDA, we recommend putting it to sleep with NVDA+SHIFT+S in desktop keyboard layout or NVDA+SHIFT+Z in the laptop layout, to prevent unwanted speech interruption. You can interrupt speech at any time on demand with the attack button.
AccessibilityLockCameraHint=The camera will automatically follow the direction of the playable character. You will also be able to strafe using the assigned button.
AccessibilityDisableCameraHint=Can help improve game responsiveness for blind players, especially on less powerful computers.
AccessibilityHighContrastModeHint=Helps make the display clearer for low-vision players. The playable character will be blue, enemies red, and interactive items yellow. Everything else will be grey, walls a slightly darker shade.
AccessibilityFirstPersonSoundHint=Sounds will play from the perspective of the playable character in the game world. This can help make the overall perception of the game world clearer, especially for blind players.
AccessibilityNavHint=Allows you to be guided in the correct direction and along the shortest available path to the selected destination at any time on demand. When the assigned button is pressed (see control settings), the playable character will turn towards the selected waypoint, and at the same time an audio cue will be played (consult the audio cue overview). Press the help button for more information.
AccessibilityNavHintHelp=Navigation assistance allows you to be guided in the right direction and along the shortest available path to the selected destination at any time on demand. When the assigned button is pressed (see control settings), the playable character will turn to the selected waypoint, and at the same time an audio cue will be played (consult the audio cue overview). You can tell in which direction the selected waypoint is in relation to you by its position in the stereo field. Thus, if the sound plays e.g. slightly right off center, it means that you will not be able to reach the waypoint by simply continuing in a straight line and will have to snap to it again later on. Use navigation assistance repeatedly over a short period of time, as some locations can be quite complex and the character will have to turn several times to successfully reach the destination.<br><br>If text narration is enabled, you will also be notified at regular intervals of the remaining distance to the destination, that you have just reached it, or that there is currently no direct path to it.<br><br>You can change the navigation destination using the assigned buttons. In each area, one or more quest waypoints are automatically available. They are named according to the quest they are related to or the place they lead to. This means that if you let yourself be guided to one of the quest waypoints, you will get to where you need to be in order to proceed with that quest. Also, there is always a „beginning of scene“ waypoint. You can always use it to return to the point where you last entered the current location, which can be useful if you get lost or want to retrace your steps and explore places you've already passed.<br><br>You can also create your own waypoints (see Control Settings). You can optionally name them. Custom waypoints will always be placed at the end of the list of all the available waypoints to cycle through. You can create an unlimited number of them for each location. You can then delete any custom waypoint by switching to it and pressing the assigned button. Holding the button down will delete all the custom waypoints for that location at once. Custom waypoints can come in handy when a particular location that might be important is difficult to find and you want to avoid having to look for it all over again from scratch if you ever want to return to it.<br><br>Each character turn takes a moment, just like in real life, and each step interrupts the ongoing turn. So, to make navigation assistance effective, either use it very frequently, basically constantly, while walking, or always stop after a few steps, use it, and then give the character a moment to turn. When riding a horse, remember that the horse has a mind of its own and moves of its own will. Therefore, it is a good idea not to gallop and to use navigation assistance all the time.<br><br>When walking through doorways, narrow passages and gaps, across bridges and the like, it is especially important to listen to where the navigation assistance audio cue is coming from. If you don't hear it from the center of the stereo field and the distance announcement doesn't indicate that you're approaching your destination, try slowing down, taking a step backwards or sideways, and using navigation assistance more frequently. Walking straight ahead for long stretches without using navigation assistance is not a good strategy. The game world is irregular, does not have orthogonal corners, and is often full of obstacles that navigation assistance must first guide you around.<br>If navigation assistance tells you that you still have a bit to go, but there is an obstacle in your way (see the sonar) and there is no way to walk around it and get closer to your destination, it means that you are going the right way, but there is something else you need to do before you can actually get to the destination. You'll have to figure out what that should be on your own. You always have enough information to do that if you read the active quests, environment description, journal entries, and the contents of your inventory (see control settings). Sometimes you need to perform a certain interaction, even using the right item from your inventory, other times you might just be missing a key to a door. Individual items, such as keys that need to be found, are almost never pointed out by navigation assistance, because your character can't possibly know where the given item might be at that moment. That's where the sonar should be used.
AccessibilityLeaveAreaHint=Prevents automatic transitions between game areas. The transitions will behave like other interactables and will need to be confirmed manually. This will also be conveyed with the corresponding audio cue.
AccessibilityAccessiblePuzzlesHint=Simplifies some of the more spatially challenging puzzles that might otherwise be very difficult for blind players to solve. The principle of the puzzles is retained, but sometimes necessary steps are omitted or the game is more benevolent to accuracy requirements.
AccessibilityAccessibleCryptingHint=Once the encrypted letter is read, it is automatically decrypted. Intended for blind players.
AccessibilityEnemyAIHint=The slowdown will be reflected in the speed at which enemies react during combat. This can help blind players in particular to achieve a more level playing field in combat, as reacting to audio cues alone can be slower than reacting to visual perception.
AccessibilityPreventKnockingHint=Prevents the playable character from being knocked down and objects from being knocked out of your hands. Only affects playable characters, not enemies. Recommended for blind players.
AccessibilityAccessibleStealthHint=Significantly reduces the distance at which enemy patrols can see the playable character. Even in this mode, however, enemies can still hear and therefore react to the sounds the playable character and his actions make.
AccessibilityMaxEnemiesToAttackHint=Limits the maximum number of enemies that can simultaneously attack the playable character. Those that do not attack, however, are still active and will pursue and intercept the playable character. They merely delay their actual attack.
AccessibilityShowSignalsHint=Displays visual signals in addition to selected audio cues.
AccessibilitySonarHint=The sonar acts as a sort of auditory white cane and signals walls and impassable obstacles. Press the help button for more information.
AccessibilitySonarNPCHint=The character sonar acts as a sort of auditory white cane and signals enemies, and friendly and neutral characters. Press the help button for more information.
AccessibilitySonarHintHelp=The sonar acts as a kind of auditory white cane and signals walls and impassable obstacles, enemies, friendly and neutral characters, as well as inanimate objects that are important in a certain situation but you cannot interact with them directly (consult the audio cue overview).<br><br>The lower the sound is pitched, and the longer the interval, the farther away the object is from you. Conversely, the higher and shorter the sound, the closer it is. If you are standing right next to the signalled object and cannot get any closer, there will not be a contiguous sound. You can tell that you are trying to pass through an impassable obstacle by the fact that the sonar sound does not change anymore even if you try to move further forward. The sonar has a range of approximately 5 fathoms (or 10 meters) forward, left and right of the playable character. Often you can hear up to three different sonar obstacle cues at the same time.<br><br>If there are too many characters around you and the sonar cues are distracting, or if you don't need the information about friendly and neutral characters at the moment, you can turn the cues for characters off at any time using the assigned button (see control settings). Just don't forget to re-enable them again before the next encounter.<br><br>The sonar is independent of the navigation assistance, and in theory it's possible to traverse the entire game from start to finish using just the sonar. In practice, however, the two features complement one another. Navigation assistance is especially useful when you don't know which way to go, or are trying to get to a specific location. The sonar is particularly useful for navigating around obstacles, finding objects, and freely exploring larger locations to get a better idea of their shape and size.
AccessibilitySonarVibrationCuesHint=Represents the sonar feedback with controller vibrations. However, unlike the audio cues, vibration feedback only works for objects straight ahead.
AccessibilityInteractionCuesHint=For each interactable or object that appears within sight of the playable character, an audio cue is played (consult the audio cue overview). Press the help button for more information.
AccessibilityInteractionCuesHintHelp=For each interactable or object that appears within sight of the playable character, an audio cue is played (consult the audio cue overview).<br><br>Using the highlight all interactable objects button will also play audio cues for all available interactables nearby (see control settings).<br><br>If navigation assistance is also enabled, you can switch between the available interactables using the assigned button. With another button, you can snap in the right direction so that you can reach the interactable. This snapping works in the same way as navigation assistance. Thus, expect to have to turn more than once on your way to an interactable sometimes. If you snap without switching to a specific interactable, the one currently closest to you will always be selected.<br><br>If an interactable is within range of the playable character, it will be announced once again, and the interactable within range audio cue will play continuously.<br><br>The button used to snap to the nearest interactable snaps to the closest enemy instead as long as your weapon is drawn. This will help you in combat to make sure you are always facing the enemy head on.
AccessibilityIgnoreTorchesHint=Disables cues and interactions for torches on walls. Retrievable torches (e.g. lying on the ground or stored in a chest) will continue to be announced.
AccessibilityCombatCuesHint=If enabled, the corresponding audio cues will play during combat (consult the audio cue overview). They will alert you when a new enemy is in sight, or when an existing one disappears from sight. You will also be notified when an enemy is just performing an attack on you, when the playable character's health has dropped to a dangerously low level, or when the current encounter is over.

// Tutorial
InterfacePlayerStatus=Character status
InterfacePlayerStatusText=In the upper left corner, you can find basic information about your character's status: His portrait, faction badge, and indicators of <color=red>Health</color> and <color=#56B061>Energy</color>. Below these, there is the money pouch where you'll collect Groschen and Ducats that you find along the way.
InterfaceQuestTracker=Quest tracker
InterfaceQuestTrackerText=Below the basic information you will always see the status of the current quest and related tasks, as well as whether they've been completed or not.
InterfaceMinimapText=In the upper right corner of the screen, you can see a simple map with a compass. On this map, you can track your immediate surroundings.
InterfaceMinimapText2=It will show: <br><color=#08A100>- friendly units</color><br><color=#FF0000>- enemies</color><br><color=#D9D6A2>- current destinations</color><br><color=#C33911>- destinations for tasks</color><br><br>You can zoom the map in and then out again.
InterfaceMessagesText=On the right beneath the minimap, important information about the status of the game and your character is displayed. When you complete a task or when you are faced with a new one, you will be notified via an information panel in the middle of the screen.
MovementTutorial1=The playable character is located in the middle of the screen. You can move him using:
MovementTutorial2=The character will then start walking in the direction in which you moved, always in relation to where the camera is facing. It doesn't matter whether you are walking or riding a horse. If you need to move faster, you can start running by pressing:
MovementTutorial3=But watch out for your <color=#56B061>energy</color> which is going to start dropping immediately, unless you are riding a horse. It's located in the top left corner and is shown in <color=#56B061>green</color> color. Too low energy will result not only in <b>a decrease of your movement speed</b> but also in <b>lower speed and power of your attacks</b> in combat. You may also come across activities which directly require sufficient energy in order to be performed at all.
MovementTutorial4=Camera zoom occurs automatically while in combat or during special events. You can <b>rotate the camera</b> with:
MovementTutorial5=Movement during combat
MovementTutorial6=Whether you use the mouse wheel or play with a controller, <b>rotating the camera is crucial</b>. Not only to notice important objects and to prevent obstacles from hindering your vision, but thanks to it you can also change the direction your character is moving.
InventoryTutorial=Inventory and interactions
InventoryMenu=Inventory menu
InventoryTutorial1=All objects you have on you can be found in your inventory in the bottom left corner of the screen. The number next to the icon represents quantity.
InventoryTutorial2=You can open the inventory by sliding your mouse over the icon or by pressing:
InventoryTutorial3=Clicking on an item opens the interaction menu. Use the secondary button to immediately carry out the <b>default action</b>. Each type of object can have a different one - books can be read, potions consumed, etc.
InventoryTutorial4=However, one of the most important actions is <b>Equip</b>. This will result in picking up the object with your hand - you can then use it on things around you! The action must of course be possible and your character must be within range. The text of the action will change into what you can do with the object.
InventoryTutorial5=You can use objects around you, and it's very important that you do so. Whenever you get close to something you can interact with, the object will be labeled and the action you can take will be written out. Remember, <b>you can't interact when your weapon is drawn</b>.
InventoryTutorial6=Do not carry anything around pointlessly. If you exceed the weight limit, your character will not be able to run.
InventoryTutorial7=You will initiate the action by pressing:
InventoryTutorial8=If several active objects are within range, you can switch between them by pressing:
InventoryTutorial9=You can have all interactable objects around the character highlighted with:
CollectiblesTutorial1=Coins represent collectibles in the game. You can find them in various places. Some will be noticeable at first glance, others you will have to carefully look for in order to acquire them.<br>
CollectiblesTutorial2=There are two kinds:<br><br>- <color=silver>Grossi Pragenses</color> are silver and more common. They can be found fairly easily.<br><br>- <color=yellow>Ducats Bohemica</color> are made of gold and it takes much more effort to find them. They are often hidden in optional areas, in remote corridors, or among other objects.
CollectiblesTutorial3=You place all collected coins in your money pouch which is displayed in the upper left corner of the screen.
CollectiblesTutorial4=With every collected coin, the information will be displayed on how many can still be found in the current scene.
CollectiblesTutorial5=<b>Coins can be used</b> even at certain points in the story, just like other items. You can purchase gear with them, try to bribe someone, and so forth.<br><br>When looking for coins, you may experience new challenges, and you will earn precious achievements for collecting them. Maybe you will want to attempt that in your second play-through of the game.
CombatTips=Strategic tips
CombatTutorial1=If you get into a conflict, the most important thing is to keep a cool head and not throw yourself recklessly into danger. If the situation allows for that, choose a good spot because when your weapon is drawn, <b>you can't interact</b> with your surroundings, which includes opening doors!
CombatTutorial3=You can draw your weapon by using the inventory, but it's faster to do it with:
CombatTutorial4=After drawing the weapon, the way you control your character changes. <b>He won't turn automatically</b> in the direction he's moving. You have to adjust the direction in which he's looking with your mouse or controller. While attacking or blocking, you must be facing your enemy directly, or your strikes will be ineffective.
CombatTutorial5=You attack with your weapon by pressing:
CombatTutorial6=When you equip a shield, you gain a significant advantage and you can defend yourself against your enemy's strikes by using:
CombatTutorial7=The value of your <color=#56B061>Energy</color> significantly impacts your overall performance. Low energy will slow you down, your strikes will be weaker, and you will not be able to use your shield effectively.
CombatTutorial8=How to conduct successful combat:<br>- watch your <color=#56B061>Energy</color><br>- keep a safe distance<br>- wait for the enemy's mistake<br>- don't let them corner or surround you<br>- if you are outnumbered, try to take advantage of your surroundings and separate the enemies
CombatTutorial10=If an enemy hits your shield, you have a short while to make use of the moment of surprise and perform a counterattack. You have to be standing close for that, within range of the shield, but if you do hit them, the blow will be much more powerful than an ordinary attack. Characters will also perform short rapid attacks at close distance. Watch out for that, or try to use it to your benefit.
PotionsTutorial1=You can find many varieties of different potions and other kinds of beverages in the game.
PotionsTutorial2=The effects of some of these will be obvious from their name (for example, <b>Liquor</b>). You will have to guess the effects of others. The color of the potion, its appearance or the place where you found it may give you a clue. In any case, be careful what you pour down your throat. Especially if there are strange symbols on the bottle.
PotionsTutorial3=Certain potions may have <b>magical properties</b> and they will come in handy when solving puzzles and tasks.
PotionsTutorial4=Almost every potion, except for absolute exceptions, is made from <b>alcohol</b>.
PotionsTutorial5=Therefore, you should take into account that consuming them will have a certain kind of influence on you. The more potions you drink, the stronger this influence will be. Alcohol will wear off again after some time.
PotionsTutorial6=Potions are usually hidden not only in storage rooms or chests. Do not conserve them more than necessary! You will come across more of them soon enough for sure. They can often significantly help you win challenging encounters, or make puzzles easier.
PotionsTutorial7=You will discover what the potion's effects are immediately after consuming it, often not just from the <b>information panel</b> on the right side of the screen.
WorldMapTutorial1=You can open the large map of Silesia by clicking on the icon in the bottom right corner of the screen or by pressing:
WorldMapTutorial2=You can change the zoom and pan it using:
WorldMapTutorial2b=If you get lost and want to return to the starting position, just press:
WorldMapTutorialLocations=Locations
WorldMapTutorial3=The map contains all the important locations in Silesia. It shows small villages, towns, castles, monasteries, but also caves or abandoned mines.
WorldMapTutorial4=The positions of <b>the Hussite field armies</b> are indicated with a large icon of a black rider with a banner, and <b>your own location</b> (if you know it yourself) is marked with a small blinking arrow.
WorldMapTutorial5=The map of Silesia is not going to help you with orientation in a specific location, that's what the <b>minimap with the compass</b> (or the accessibility features) is for, but you can open it if you want to find out where you are in the world or where a town or castle that's been mentioned in the game is located.
BooksTutorial=Reading
BooksTutorial1=You may come across interesting objects during your wanderings - books, scrolls and letters. Since you are not just some common peasant and you were lucky enough to have received a good education, you are able to read them.
BooksTutorial2=Except for a very rare few, these objects are <b>optional</b> and you will manage to complete the game without them.
BooksTutorial3=Books contain additional information about the world in which the game takes place. They intertwine the story with real history. You will learn various interesting facts from them but you can also read the descriptions of magic rituals or recipes for magical potions.
BooksTutorial4=Missives and letters have their own recipients and they will reveal more about the motivations of individual characters as well as secret information which was not supposed to fall into your hands at all. This could be helpful in deciding how to proceed or discovering valuable hints.
BooksTutorial5=Some people might want to keep certain information truly secret. That's where encoded letters and secret scripts come into play. In the section dedicated to <b>deciphering</b>, you will learn how to decipher the contents of such messages.
StealthTutorial1=You may find yourself in a situation where the only solution is to sneak around your enemies unnoticed, or you may need to crawl under an obstacle. You can crouch by pressing:
StealthTutorial2=Sneaking lets you keep an eye on where your enemies can see and where you're safe from their gaze. You will also be able to look around. The camera will pan in the direction you want when you hold down the button:
StealthTutorial3=In addition to the <b>areas marking the enemies' field of view</b>, circles will appear around you to <b>represent the noise</b> made by you or the objects you manipulate (e.g. doors). The circle is large at first, but quickly shrinks. If its edge reaches an enemy character, you may be compromised and the guards will start searching for what caused the noise. If they find nothing, they soon return to their normal routine.
StealthTutorial4=Take your time! First, observe the enemies, find out what their <b>habits</b> are, or where the <b>patrol routes</b> lead. Once you have an overview and an opportunity, don't wait for anything and go! No risk, no gain. Don't forget that sound can also give you away to an enemy who has his back turned to you. Your footsteps are quiet as you sneak, but not inaudible.
DeciphermentTutorial1=During the game, you will come across messages which their author wanted to make very secret and therefore used a cipher or a secret script. You don't have to decipher those right away, but they might provide useful hints in relation to your next steps. In order to read their contents, you will have to decipher the text.
DeciphermentTutorial2=On the right side of the screen, there is the decypherment table with <b>symbols</b> and <b>letters</b>. The letters can be moved around freely by dragging them with the mouse, or using the keyboard or controller. By placing the letter at the square under the symbol, it will be grayed out and the text will be modified accordingly.
DeciphermentTips=Deciphering tips
DeciphermentTutorial3=Focus on short words first (prepositions and conjunctions) or words which you know might be found in the letter (names of people, greetings, names of places). Move the letters around and test out how it affects the resulting text. Once you've deciphered several basic letters, the rest of the letter will be a piece of cake.
DeciphermentTutorial4=The progress of the deciphering will be saved automatically and you can come back to the text at any time.
Story=Story
FarkleTutorial1=At some points in the game, you will have a moment of respite and get the opportunity to sit at a table and play Farkle. It's played according to <b>mildly modified rules called Silesian Farkle</b>.
FarkleTutorial2=The game is played by two players who take turns trying to reach <b>10,000 points</b> as soon as possible. At the start of the turn, a player always rolls all the dice. After each roll, he may <b>put aside one or more dice</b>, but must always put aside at least <b>50 points</b> or his turn ends and he scores no points. Once he has put aside <b>all six dice</b>, he indicates that he does not wish to continue rolling. The points scored from one or more of the combinations he has accumulated throughout the turn are then counted.
FarkleTutorial3=The player can thus tactically collect dice for the specific combination he wishes to achieve and, despite partial small gains, eventually assemble the dice into a combination that will yield a large point gain.
FarkleTutorial4=The controls are simple. You can only ever interact with the cup or the dice. The dice can either be put aside or put back. You can use the cup to roll again, or to pass the dice to your opponent. You do this if you set aside all six dice at the same time.
FarkleTutorialCombinations=Scoring combinations
FarkleTutorial5=One - 100 points
FarkleTutorial6=Five - 50 points
FarkleTutorial7=Three 1's - 1000 points
FarkleTutorial8=3 of a kind - number times 100 points
FarkleTutorial9=4 of a kind - 3 of a kind score x2
FarkleTutorial10=5 of a kind - 3 of a kind score x4
FarkleTutorial11=6 of a kind - 3 of a kind score x8
FarkleTutorial12=Three different pairs - 1500 points
FarkleTutorial13=Straight - 1500 points
FarkleTutorial14=Straight without a six - 500 points
FarkleTutorial15=Straight without a one - 750 points

JournalHistoryEntry1=Europe is in the middle of religious upheaval and many preachers predict the imminent end of the world and the arrival of the Antichrist.
JournalHistoryEntry2=A number of preachers and scholars criticize the moral decline of the catholic church, large possessions of the priests, and their sinful life. One of the leading personalities demanding reformation is the rector of Prague university, Jan Huss. Among other things, he speaks against the declared crusades and the indulgences for anyone who takes part in the fighting. He calls the pope the Antichrist and the pope, in turn, calls him a heretic and excommunicates him. The situation culminates at the council in Konstanz where Jan Huss is sentenced and burnt at the stake.
JournalHistoryEntry3=It had the complete opposite effect than the council intended - instead of the heretic teachings vanishing, they started spreading rapidly through Bohemian lands and Huss was worshipped as a martyr. A movement emerged, with the chalice as its symbol, representing one of the demands of reformation - communion under both kinds as an expression of equality between priests and lay people. But soon differences started manifesting among the Calixtins as well (social differences, differences in opinions and interests), which eventually led to the formation of several Hussite streams - from moderate to completely radical.
JournalHistoryEntry4=The situation was escalating especially in Prague. The king of Bohemia, Wenceslaus IV, did try to prevent the increase in revolutionary moods and installed new councillors at the New Town Hall, who started arresting Hussites. Before long, Hussites attacked New Town Hall and threw the councillors out of the windows. When news of this reached the ears of Wenceslaus IV, he was beset by a fit of rage and died within several weeks as a consequence.
JournalHistoryEntry5=His brother, the Hungarian and Roman King Sigismund, became the only successor to the Bohemian throne. The nobility in essence approved of this, but in accordance with the customs at the time, they assembled a list of conditions under which Sigismund would take a seat on the Bohemian throne. The Four Articles of Prague became the common testament. They demanded - communion from the chalice, freedom to preach the word of God, Church without properties and secular powers, and punishments of mortal sins regardless of the stature of the sinner. Sigismund refused to accept the conditions and departed for Wrocław, where he started preparing for a crusade against the Hussites.
JournalHistoryEntry6=Bohemia became engulfed in revolutionary unrest. The so-called lesser lands of the Bohemian Crown, Silesia and Lusatia, stayed loyal to the Catholic Church. A section of radical Hussites decided to build a new city, which was given the biblical name Tabor. They addressed one another as brother and sister and were led, among others, by John Zizka of Trocnov, who proved himself an excellent military leader. He was never defeated even though he commanded others in complete blindness during his last years. The Taborites, under Zizka's command, gradually conquered catholic castles and cities in Bohemia, and together with other Hussites managed to fend off all of the crusades which the Pope had declared against them.
JournalHistoryEntry7=In the spring of 1423, disputes between the uncompromising Zizka and Taborite priests culminated in his departure and the forming of a new union. Its members started calling themselves Orphans after Zizka's death.
JournalHistoryEntry8=Since 1427, some sort of power stability has emerged, stemming from the cooperation of all Hussite unions and also owing to the strong personality of Prokop the Shaven, who maintains live contacts with Prague as well. The Hussites go on the offensive and conduct glorious rides past the borders of the Kingdom of Bohemia become a part of their military tactics. Silesia remains even now strictly catholic and actively takes part in trade blockades and crusades against the Hussites. The powerful Bishop of Wrocław Konrad leads Silesia.
JournalHistoryEntry9=At the beginning of 1428, the Taborites along with Orphans, Praguers, and Moravian Hussites, set off together for a joint campaign, with Prokop the Shaven as their leader. They head to Moravia, first to the Upper Hungary which they plunder, but then they turn sharply back to the North and invade Silesia through the Moravian Gate. This cover-up maneuver completely confuses Silesian cities which are not prepared for the Hussites' arrival at the time at all.

01_FireAndBlood_Intro=<i>Thursday, March 11, 1428.</i> Our army crossed the border of Silesia. Duke Wenceslas of Opava hastily and enthusiastically signed a peace treaty. Unfortunately, an accident struck the expedition on the way back from his castle. Our hetman Velek of Bresnitz was thrown off his horse, broke his leg and had to be left there in treatment. Hetman Blazek of Kralup became our commander instead. He's always hated me but he's an experienced warrior. I just need to stay out of his way and it will be fine.
01_FireAndBlood_FindProkopJournal=Just before Röwersdorf, I was instructed to join the people of the Polish knight Dobeslav Puchala of Wieniawa along with my troop. We have to set off for Hennersdorf and then proceed all the way to Zuckmantel. From the other side, from the direction of Hermannstadt, Otto of Losy should back us up, and we should join forces at Edelstein castle.
01_FireAndBlood_SmokeJournal=After we burned down Hennersdorf, we noticed smoke in the west! Puchala sent me and the guys to investigate. Maybe Bishop Konrad's people are trying to get in on our backs?
01_FireAndBlood_ChaseJournal=In Petersdorf, we came across strange unknown men. They were setting fire to the entire village! We started pursuing them.
01_FireAndBlood_FindWayOutJournal=I almost had them when they ran inside a cave. I ran after them and guess what happened? Some kind of sorcery or something. The entrance was caved in behind me and I was trapped inside.
01_05_EntranceJournal=I found the entrance to a large underground vault inside the cave! What the hell is that supposed to mean?
01_05_2_CaveAmbushJournal=Those three vagabonds were waiting for me in the shadows and tried to kill me.
01_05_2_CaveAmbushJournalKilled=One of them was carrying a strange object in the shape of a cross. What could it be for?
01_05_LostInCaveFinishedJournal=I couldn't find my way out. Instead, I found a way to another level through a locked door.
01_FireAndBlood_FindUnknownMenJournal=In the lower level of the vault, I came across a few people, probably villagers. There was also the last remaining black-clad person and a certain priest. As soon as they spotted me, they tried to kill me without hesitation.
01_FireAndBlood_GetThroughDoorJournal=The priest and the man dressed in black ran off into a room and locked themselves in.
01_FireAndBlood_GetThroughDoorJournalEnd=I finally managed to get inside. The priest was just opening a magical portal! The man in black was defending him and he attacked me. But there was something wrong about him. His eyes were shining red and his face was sunken and pale. As if he wasn't even alive anymore.
01_FireAndBlood_PortalJournal=I ran through the magical portal to stop the priest from getting away. Then darkness fell.

02_ForTheGloryOfGod_Intro=<i>Monday, March 15 1428</i>. The heretics invaded Silesia through the Moravian Gate. The Army of Prokop the Shaven, ten thousand strong, is advancing from the South, from the direction of Röwersdorf and Osoblaha. The bishop called us to arms to defend our faith. Most of the brethren left on Friday with the prior, and today I am leaving the commandery with the last of the men. A difficult battle awaits us at Nysa but God is on our side. There is nothing to fear.
02_ForTheGloryOfGod_LetterToAnna=I sent a letter to my sister at Reichenstein. I trust that Anna is safe in the castle.
02_ForTheGloryOfGod_RuprechtTalkJournal=<i>Thursday, March 18 1428</i>. In crastino Sancte Gertrudis. We have been hiding behind the walls of Nysa for nearly two days, and except for the Hussites burning the outskirts of the town, nothing much has happened. The commanders are being secretive and no one wants to say anything. They are afraid of Hussite spies which are, allegedly, everywhere. Even among the crusaders. We had to wait until today's morning. They awakened us two hours before sunrise and our group is supposed to report at St. Nicholas gate. We armed ourselves and set off.
02_ForTheGloryOfGod_RuprechtTalkFinishedJournal=Prior Rupert let me in on the secret plan, concocted by Sir Puota of Czastolowitz. Under the cover of darkness, small groups of Knights of St. John will enter the Hussite encampment. They will eliminate the guards, start fires, and as soon as the heretics start waking up, they will create as much commotion as possible among their ranks. I will be leading one of the groups. Fires inside the encampment will be a signal for the infantry to attack. And if any of the heretics try to flee, the cavalry, waiting on standby, will run them down.
02_ForTheGloryOfGod_LeaveCityFinishedJournal=I selected five men and we charged forward from the city through St. Nicholas gate.
02_ForTheGloryOfGod_TrapJournal=The plan of Puota of Czastolowitz would have been flawless if the Hussites had not known about it in advance. We fell into a trap set for us. As soon as we managed to sneak far enough into the Hussite camp, they surrounded us and attacked.
02_ForTheGloryOfGod_RuprechtSavedJournal=The heretics outnumbered us and were able to use the moment of surprise. In the end, it was our soldiers who were running away into the city in panic. Prior Rupert himself was pulled down from his horse while retreating, and Puota's cavalry was unable to fight their way back to him. God wanted me to be nearby and save the prior who was fighting outnumbered.
02_ForTheGloryOfGod_RuprechtSafeStartJournal=We pulled back towards Nysa but the Bielau gate was already surrounded by Hussites. Together with the prior, we fought our way to safety behind the palisades. The gate closed behind us, but not for long. The Hussites broke through it with their battering ram and flooded the streets. No one remained there to properly stand up to them anymore. Most of the nobles preferred to save their own skin by fleeing behind the stone walls. Small groups of badly trained burghers and villagers could not resist the Hussites for long. It was only a matter of time before the Old Town would fall.
02_ForTheGloryOfGod_LittleGirlJournal=We were heading for the protection of the New Town walls as well. Along the way, a little girl stopped us and asked us to help her mother. We couldn't have known that it was just another trap. The girl led us to a side alley where unknown fighters attacked us. They were pale and their eyes glowed as if they were demons. With the help of all the saints, we defeated them. That brat from Hell vanished before we could interrogate her. I am starting to be afraid that the Hussite heretics have formed a pact with the Devil himself.
02_ForTheGloryOfGod_JoachimJournal=We kept on moving forward, and by the Church of the Assumption of Virgin Mary, we witnessed a miracle. It's another proof that God is on our side. Lightning tore through the roof of the House of God and killed the Hussite hetman who was about to loot it. His companions fled in all directions, in terror and among the flames of God's wrath. The local priest, Joachim Weinhard, saved thanks to God's will, joined me and the prior.
02_ForTheGloryOfGod_Finished=We saved ourselves in the New Town but it didn't bring peace to our souls. From the gallery on the walls, we had to watch all of the 90 houses of the Old Town burn to ashes. The Hussites tried to conquer the New Town as well but the stone fortifications and resistance of the inhabitants, with Puota of Czastolowitz in the lead, prevented them from succeeding. The Hussites didn't waste time with a siege. They left and set up a new encampment at Patschkau.
02_ForTheGloryOfGod_Finished2=The fall of Nysa fanned my inner worries. Is Anna safe at Reichenstein? The prior gave me permission to go get my sister and find a more suitable refuge for her. But I have to go alone because after the slaughter in the Old Town, the Order of St. John doesn't have men to spare. While I was getting ready for my trip to Reichenstein, the prior and the surviving brethren, together with the bishop, left the city via the Wrocław gate.
02_ForTheGloryOfGod_DietmarAlzeyDied=Dietmar of Alzey fell under my command. Forgive me, brother, I will pray for you.

03_DeepInHole_KidnappedJournal=<i>March 1428. Maybe Sunday?</i> I received a pretty strong blow to the head, and quite possibly they broke my nose as well. It's not the first time. I won't be becoming a troubadour, but luckily, I've never planned for that kind of career anyway. I prefer fucking village girls rather than insipid countesses. They tossed me into an oubliette, and judging from the rumbling in my stomach, it's been a few days. I'd be long dead if there wasn't a leak somewhere in the wall. I drink from puddles like a dog. Better than drinking my own piss.
03_DeepInHole_OublietteJournal=I woke up just as some woman was talking to two knights by the name of von Czirn right above me. She mentioned Monsterberg, the seat of Duke John, as well as the fact that they are supposed to get rid of me. I realized that unless I get out of here fast, I won't live to see Easter.
03_DeepInHole_OublietteCompletedJournal=It was pretty hard but I made it out of the oubliette.
03_DeepInHole_Gromnik=I found a ledger in one of the living quarters and now I know for sure, thanks to the burgrave's notes. The castle is called Rabesberg. Now just to figure out which damn rock in Silesia it's perched on.
03_DeepInHole_CryptedLetter=While fleeing the castle, I ran into one of the knights von Czirn who was banging two maids with so much noise that he didn't even notice me stealing some sort of a letter from his chamber. It's written in a cipher. I should find out what sort of villainy it's talking about.
03_DeepInHole_EscapeDrain=I was hoping to escape through the drainage channel but that did not work out. I have to come up with something else.
03_DeepInHole_EscapeFoot=I managed to escape from the castle. Thank God! But how am I going to get back to my people?
03_DeepInHole_EscapeHorse=An opportunity landed right in my lap. I stole a messenger's horse and rode out through the open gate. Unfortunately, they started chasing me right away.
03_DeepInHole_ChaseJournal=I managed to shake those bastards off in the end. But still, I didn't dare use the road. I left the horse there. It would make too much noise and leave tracks in the forest. I set off on foot to god-knows-where, hoping that I might come across a landmark that would help me find the way to my folks.
03_DeepInHole_UnicornJournal=I was wandering through the forest in darkness and rain. When I couldn't even see the tip of my own nose, I sat down on a stump to figure out how to proceed. Right at that moment, a light appeared in front of me. At first just a light, and then that animal inside it. A white unicorn.

04_WelcomeHome_IntroJournal=I arrived to the gates of Reichenstein, and instead of a welcome, I received an arrow under my horse's hooves. I don't have a clue what could have happened here but it seems that the castle has been taken over by enemies. I have to find out what happened to Anna. God willing, she is alive.
04_WelcomeHome_EscapeCorridorJournal=I remembered an escape corridor which led to the forest outside the gates. That's my chance to get inside without being noticed.
04_WelcomeHome_EscapeCorridorJournal2=I came across several charred bodies inside the underground passage. One of them was the burgrave. They were probably trying to get out of the castle. I can't quite find an explanation for it but it looked as though a firestorm had swept through the entire corridor. God give rest to their souls.
04_WelcomeHome_SearchBergfriedJournal=I followed the corridor all the way to the cellars of the bergfried.
04_WelcomeHome_BergfriedAnnaJournal=I found the master chambers on the uppermost floor in havoc. It seemed that a struggle had taken place in there. The furniture was overturned and traces of blood were everywhere. And in the center of it all stood Anna. I could hear her calling my name. And then she dissolved. Was she a phantom? Is God testing my faith? Or is the devil tempting me? I couldn't understand anything, but what I do believe is that my sister is alive, and that battle exhaustion and a long time with no sleep are taking their toll on me.
04_WelcomeHome_SearchBergfriedFinishedJournal=I searched the entire room, and the only things I found were a drawing of an unknown man and a half-written letter which Anna hadn't managed to finish. Despite everything, I feel that she is alright. She has to be! And I will do everything within my power to find clues that will lead me to her. I don't have any choice but to look around the castle and search the palace.
04_WelcomeHome_CourtyardJournal=In the courtyard, I found brother Adalbert who had been delivering my letter to my sister at Reichenstein. Those dogs had caught him and hanged him. The rest of the castle's garrison had met a similar end. They had been massacred, their bodies tossed onto a pile. They will pay for this. May they be cursed!
04_WelcomeHome_BasementJournal=I found nothing that could be of any help in the palace. But in the cellars, I found a door which wouldn't open. Someone must be hiding behind it! Maybe some of our people survived the attack? I have to figure out how to get in there.
04_WelcomeHome_EscapeJournal=The cook barricaded himself in with the wine and the castle's provisions. He was completely drunk but I managed to get at least some information out of him. A few days ago, a group of about twenty riders in black cowls arrived to Reichenstein, led by a young woman. They announced themselves in the name of John of Monsterberg, who had allegedly sent them to warn Anna of the Hussites. The castle guards let them in but the strangers attacked them at the first opportunity. Only the cook managed to hide in the cellars. The last thing he heard was that they were in a hurry because they had some business in the Red Mine. After that, he just drank until he was completely out of it, waiting for someone to rescue him. It's not much but at least I have something to latch on. Now I have to get out of the castle and head to the mine.
04_WelcomeHome_FireJournal=The drunk cook wasn't my only complication on the way out. As soon as I opened the door, riders surprised me. They had to be a part of the group which had taken over the castle and kidnapped my sister. They barricaded us in the palace and started setting fire to the entire castle.
04_WelcomeHome_FinalJournal=Not much separated us from burning to death. Luckily, the Holy Spirit enlightened me and I got the idea to use the privy chute to escape. Even though it was high up, we managed to significantly shorten the jump from such a height using a rope. I sent the cook to his family in the nearby town of Jawirnik. He thanked me profusely and then offered his help. He said he was from a farm where they would reward me with provisions and perhaps even a horse, to replace the one I've lost. I didn't want to be delayed. I was afraid that my only clue would slip through my fingers, but I didn't have much choice. I needed a horse. That same night, I left the farm by the light of torches and headed for the Red Mine.

05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_Intro=<i>Friday, March 19, 1428.</i> The unicorn carried me off. It ran and then even flew with me on its back. Mountains came into view in the plain ahead of us. It may have been the Golden Mountains. It took a long time before the unicorn finally stopped in a forest. It dumped me on the grass and vanished. I could see light in the darkness, and when I approached it, I spotted a figure. A man was standing in front of an illuminated entrance to an old mine. He bore a strong resemblance to my old acquaintances from the cave. A dark hood, glowing eyes, and a medallion around his neck. I decided to investigate and enter.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_GetThroughDoorJournal=I snuck deeper into the mine and there were guards all over the place. I didn't learn anything significant from my investigations though. Then I came across locked bars. I decided that I had to get past them and uncover the secrets of my captors from Rabesberg. From what I've seen so far, I suspect it's not going to be anything nice.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_SkeletonJournal=God save my soul! Actual skeletons were staggering around behind the bars! Undead guardians in the mine. I knew that by now, I had to be ready for anything.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_PetersLetterJournal=I found a letter from a Peter to a girl named Mary in a dead-end mine corridor. It was lying beneath the hand of a dead, decaying body. Probably the author of the letter. God rest his soul.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_WaterJournal=I came across a flooded room. The water looks deep and there is no way to get across. I need to get to the other side but I can't swim.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_ElevatorRepairJournal=I found a mine elevator behind the flooded room but it didn't work. The mechanism was damaged. I improvised a little and was able to make it operational in the end.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_UndergroundJournal=The mine shaft led me deeper underground. Even though on the surface the mine didn't appear to be functional anymore, the bottom level echoed with the sounds of pickaxes pounding at the rock.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_ObsessedVillagers=A short while later, I came across the first miner. He didn't seem to notice my presence at all. Maybe he was under a spell.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_ObsessedVillagersKilledFirst=I decided the miners were being controlled by unholy powers, and that they were no longer human beings. I put one out of his misery and killed him.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_ObsessedVillagersKilledAll=Then I ended the lives of all those possessed miners.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_MarieJournal1=I found out from the prisoners that they'd been taken from their villages under a pretext or kidnapped forcibly. The people are from areas far and wide. The scope of this madness is starting to terrify me.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_MarieJournal2=They are forcing these people to do slave labor here because they are looking for a stone which supposedly fell in here straight from heaven in the past. I have to get it before they do.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_MarieJournal3=Whatever these criminals are planning, they may pose a risk to our army. And God knows what might spread into Bohemia from Silesia then, if dark forces are helping them. Koschei himself is supposedly guarding this place.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_MarieSuicideJournal=Mary, one of the imprisoned villagers, killed herself right after being released. She walked to the edge of a cliff and jumped down without a second thought. I shouldn't have told her the truth about her husband.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_PrisonersJournal=Cages were placed in one of the tunnels, with several dozen people crammed inside.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_PrisonersHelpAll=I couldn't leave the prisoners there. I released them from the cages, and God be thanked, they were able to get back to the surface safely. The rest is up to them.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_PrisonersHelpSome=I couldn't save all the prisoners. I did what I could. May God forgive me.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_PrisonersHelpKilled=It shouldn't have happened like that. I couldn't leave the prisoners there, so I released them from their cages. The undead were waiting for them in the corridors and slaughtered them all. God forgive me.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_PrisonersHelpNo=Others determined the fate of these prisoners and it wasn't up to me to get involved. I left them there. God save their souls.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_KoscheiJournal=I entered the deepest level of the mine and came across the sorcerer Koschei! So, it's him and his lackeys who's to be blamed for all these poor souls.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_KoscheiKilledJournal=I killed him. Koschei burned to ashes when I tossed his heart into the flames. His undead servants fell to the ground along with him, and, unfortunately, all of the possessed miners as well. There was no saving them. His power had probably penetrated too deep into their souls.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_MineCollapseJournal=Suddenly, the mine started caving in. The magic was holding it together more than I'd thought.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_ElevatorJournal=I quickly ascended back to the surface on the mine elevator. I barely made it in time.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_EncounterJournal=A Hospitaller knight surprised me in the corridor. He appeared out of nowhere and barked at me: „Speak! Where is my sister!“
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_LotharDeadJournal=There was no point in talking to him. I unsheathed my weapon and defended myself with steel. God knows who fights for the truth and who fights for false idols. The mine continued to collapse, rocks falling, stones pouring down. I got out at the last moment. The crusader stayed inside and was caved in under the rubble.<br><br>The mysterious stone and other secrets remain buried beneath a pile of rocks.
05_EnemyOfMyEnemy_LotharAliveJournal=His name was Lothar and his sister's name was Anna. Someone kidnapped her from the family castle Reichenstein, and the crusader was convinced that Hussites were implicated in it. The tracks led him all the way here, where he'd unexpectedly crossed paths with me. I told him everything I knew. About the Czirn brothers, Koschei, as well as the unknown woman and Monsterberg. He set off after his brethren and then to find her. As far as I'm concerned, I don't give a shit. I have to quickly return to Prokop and the others.<br><br>The crusader didn't even stab me in the back in farewell. He let me go my way in peace. But we must both be aware that sooner or later, our swords will have to clash again.<br><br>The mysterious stone and other secrets remain buried beneath a pile of rocks.

06_LegacyOfTemplars_ReturnJournal=<i>Sunday, March 21st, 1428.</i> For nearly three days, I travelled back to the commandery on horseback. In Little Oels, however, a shock awaited me. Not long before my arrival, a terrible massacre must have taken place there. Blood and corpses of my brethren were everywhere.
06_LegacyOfTemplars_BrotherJohnJournal=Brother John was the only one who'd survived. He managed to tell me that Rupert had gone to the bishop in Wrocław, but then he succumbed to his heavy injuries. I held him in my arms as he left to join the Lord. I have to find out what this was about and make sure these godless murderers are punished.
06_LegacyOfTemplars_CryptJournal=I found tracks which led me to the chapel. Someone had been manipulating the large stone slab which covered the entrance to the crypt. Is the mystery which caused this massacre hiding beneath?
06_LegacyOfTemplars_CryptFinishedJournal=I moved the slab with the help of my horse. The underground entrance is clear.
06_LegacyOfTemplars_WallJournal=Inside the crypt, I found an ossuary and graves of Templar knights. An inscription on the wall, between two angel statues, gave me a crazy idea. I ran headfirst at the wall and then… Then passed through it, like a ghost. I found myself inside a secret treasury which consisted of three rooms. In the center of the main one stood four strange statues and a small altar.
06_LegacyOfTemplars_StatuesJournal=The statues had names of angels carved in their pedestals and they could be rotated. I realized that if I turned them in the correct directions, I would reveal a hidden secret. And indeed! An opening appeared in the ceiling through which sunlight poured in and illuminated the altar with three hollow spots.
06_LegacyOfTemplars_OpenJournal=I placed a tripod, which I'd found tossed aside up in the chapel, in the hollow spots. I replaced a broken glass which was missing from it with a Groschen. Once light started reflecting from the coin, I could hardly believe what was happening. A strange triple head turned and revealed its treasure. An ornate chest slid into the room. But its guardians were awakened as well. Two cursed Templar souls returned to reanimate the old, dingy robes and attack me.
06_LegacyOfTemplars_ExploreFinishedJournal=I saw a Templar's cross on the chest's lid, as well as the words Lancea Domini. The Spear of Destiny. Within, I found only the remnants of an old piece of linen, covered in greasy stains in the shape of a spear. Could this chest have truly held the spear with which the roman soldier had pierced the side of the crucified Jesus Christ? The person who stole it could thus gain unimaginable power. I won't find anything else of help in Little Oels, and traveling to the brethren in Wrocław would lose me too much time. I have a friend in Monsterberg who has an interest in biblical artifacts. Even the confused Hussite from the Red Mine spoke of Monsterberg. Perhaps God is truly trying to lead me there.

07_ItsAllHerFault_IntroJournal=<i>Sunday, March 21, 1428.</i> The army set up their encampment at Patschkau where they await the messenger from the local lords. With God's help, I caught up with them here just as priest Prokop the Lesser was conducting Mass under the open sky. He almost dropped the chalice in surprise! Straw and the others went nearly crazy with excitement. And thus, we started celebrating. There's much to celebrate after all! Not only the fact that I've returned alive and in good health, but our wagons are filling with loot and we haven't even marched through all of Silesia yet.<br><br>I almost forgot. My unit got a new password. I'd better write it down here before I forget it. HELFTER. Such horsecrap!
07_ItsAllHerFault_HangoverJournal=<i>Monday, March 22, 1428.</i> I woke up in a meadow behind the camp, with a hellish headache. To the devil with it! A bitch of a hangover and a blank mind! The last thing I can remember is Prokop's Mass. God knows what I did afterwards?
07_ItsAllHerFault_HangoverFinishedJournal=In my house, we used to say that one nail drives out another. Just a gulp of spirits and the hangover was gone.
07_ItsAllHerFault_GuardJournal=The guard didn't want to let me enter the camp until I told him the password. Luckily, I remembered.
07_ItsAllHerFault_SmellJournal=Back at my tent, I had to rinse myself a bit because the swarms of flies following me around were starting to attract unnecessary attention.
07_ItsAllHerFault_YesterdayJournal=I found out from Straw that Dobeslav Puchala was pretty mad at me because I'd puked all over his surcoat last night. Apparently, he'd pulled out his hunting knife and chased me all around the camp. What's worse, he'd complained to hetman Blazek of Kralup. Now I'm in danger of not only being flogged for drunkenness, but also of being forced to walk on foot as punishment once the army starts marching.
07_ItsAllHerFault_TomorrowJournal=Today, messengers from nearby towns and courts will be arriving with ransom. If someone doesn't come, we will pay them a visit ourselves tomorrow.
07_ItsAllHerFault_OrangePotionJournal=I don't know what came over me but I drank the bottle of laxative and then spent an hour in the latrine. I must have gone completely nuts after yesterday.
07_ItsAllHerFault_MonsterbergJournal=I sought out father Divish in order to confess. While I was there, he confirmed to me that we were expecting messengers today. After the victorious battle of Nysa, certain lords of Silesian towns are trying to negotiate a truce and convince Prokop to somewhat alter the route of our march and avoid their holdings. In the morning, the envoy from Ludwig of Olawa entered the camp, but I'm more interested in who will be coming from Monsterberg to negotiate in the name of Duke John. I remember the unknown woman talking about him in the castle while I was in the oubliette.
07_ItsAllHerFault_AccessDeniedJournal=Prokop didn't leave anything to chance and the area around the main tent is being guarded. No one uninvited can get inside for the negotiations, including me. I have to think of something because I definitely want to take a good look at the Monsterberg party.
07_ItsAllHerFault_WineJournal=Guard Ambrose asked me to bring him some wine from the barrel. I'm happy to oblige.
07_ItsAllHerFault_AmbroseJournal=I hope brother Ambrose never finds out that I had to add the laxative to his wine in order to have a secret look at the Monsterberg messengers.
07_ItsAllHerFault_ProkopJournal=Through a hole in the canvas, I peeked inside the tent where the meeting had just finished. A beautiful woman was leading the messengers from Monsterberg. I've never seen her before. However, when Prokop proposed to her for John of Monsterberg to join the Hussite ranks, she stopped playing the nice lady and gave a sardonic reply. I immediately recognized her by her voice. She was the same one who gave the order to kill me at Rabesberg.
07_ItsAllHerFault_ProkopJournalFinished=I asked the hetmans to be allowed to infiltrate the Monsterberg party as a spy. At first, they were against the idea, but once they considered that the blasphemy I told them about could indeed be happening at Monsterberg, they agreed. I'm also to keep in mind, though, that if I find myself in dire straits, no one would come to my aid. Tomorrow, the field armies will head towards Falkenberg, the seat of Duke Bernard. If all goes as planned, I will meet the brethren there.
07_ItsAllHerFault_InfiltrateJournal=I watched their camp for a while but didn't see anything mischievous. I have no choice but to draw closer. I'll just peek inside a couple tents. Let's hope it doesn't all get fucked up… If someone notices me, the plan is damned.
07_ItsAllHerFault_HideJournal=Even the second half of my plan came to fruition. I hid in one of the wagons, inside an empty chest that had held the treasure sent by the Duke as ransom. I'm determined to sneak into Monsterberg, and perhaps get all the way to John himself, just so I can figure out what is going on there. That noble lady smells of brimstone, I have a nose for that! The Duke is nourishing a viper in his bosom.
07_ItsAllHerFault_LilithJournal=I found documents in which John of Monsterberg and the burghers entrust the suspicious Lilith woman with representing their interests in the negotiations with Prokop and the brethren. I wonder how she managed to bewitch him.
07_ItsAllHerFault_CastleJournal=<i>Tuesday, March 23, 1428.</i> Lady Fortune stood by my side. I got all the way into the city itself without anyone noticing me. Unfortunately, the wagon wasn't headed for the castle as I'd hoped, but they parked it by the parsonage of the local Franciscan church. I have to go on on foot. The problem is that with the chalice on my chest, I stand out like a sore thumb.
07_ItsAllHerFault_RobeTakenJournal=A naked Franciscan is probably going to be running around here somewhere. That's what he gets for having his robe washed, surely out of conceit. If he'd humbly served his Lord in dirt, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to steal his cowl. I put it on over my armor. Hopefully I'm more inconspicuous that way.
07_ItsAllHerFault_LotharJournal=I walked across the entire city dressed as a Franciscan, but right before the castle gate, that knight Hospitaller Lothar who threatened me in Red Mine suddenly stepped out of an apothecary. My disguise was much worse than his memory. He recognized me and followed me all the way to the courtyard. He tried to threaten me, so I spat out straight away that I was tracking a woman who'd probably kidnapped his sister as well. In return, I found out that since the times of the Knights Templar, the commandery in Little Oels had been the hiding place of the Spear of Destiny, which someone has now stolen. Something very strange is going on here! We agreed on a temporary truce and decided to help one another out. We have to speak to the Duke. All the clues lead to him.
07_ItsAllHerFault_CastleInsideJournal=Lothar came back from the castle with bad news. The Duke would receive him only next week at the earliest. Our mission, however, cannot be postponed, so we shall grant the permission to enter to ourselves.
07_ItsAllHerFault_RopeJournal=I wouldn't have been myself if I couldn't come up with something. They would admit Lothar into the palace, and then he'd let me in. He'd throw a rope down to me from a window, and I'd climb it up.
07_ItsAllHerFault_RopeFinishedJournal=Despite minor issues with a pack of filthy dogs, I managed to get inside the palace. Now just to find the Duke's chambers.
07_ItsAllHerFault_DefeatLilithJournal=Lothar freaked out a little when I trapped the guards in the corridor with a broom. But it was him who didn't want me to kill them. I thought he would explain matters to the Duke but we caught him right in the act. I'm not entirely sure how lenient Mother Church is going to be in regards to intercourse with a demon. He was fucking the Lilith whore and we just happened by. She changed into her true form and charged at us. We didn't cower in fear. I showed her how us Moravians do battle, and Lothar wasn't too bad either. When she realized she didn't stand a chance, she fled through the window.
07_ItsAllHerFault_EscapeJournal=I held back and let the pup speak to the Duke. He revealed to us that he'd met that hellish bitch in Nysa in front of the Church of the Assumption of Virgin Mary. She had been speaking to the church's priest there by the staircase. His name was something like Faenard, Lothar is surely going to remember it. After that, the Duke was all excuses, that he didn't remember anything, that he must have been bewitched, and who knows what else. The only other thing he let slip was that Faenard had met Lilith in the Brieg Monastery. We don't have any other leads. Pretty weak if you consider that we'd held his Grace by the balls. Lothar might be competent with the sword but he doesn't know a thing about people. He nearly told the Duke more than what we found out from him. I think that His Grace is a lying crook and he's in on it with the winged bitch. As soon as he reached the door, he sent the guards for us and was like: „Hang them,“ fuck him!
07_ItsAllHerFault_EscapeFinishedJournal=We barely made it out of the palace, and a moment later, the city bells started tolling. The Duke was all about catching us and silencing us forever. In the courtyard, we jumped onto two horses and rode out through the gate just before it closed. It seems that me and the crusader cub are in this mess together. We will travel to Brieg and see what we can find out there… The field armies are headed in the same direction. If necessary, I can easily reach them.

08_OnTheOtherSide_BriegJournal=<i>Friday, March 26, 1428.</i> The Brieg monastery is a day's ride from Monsterberg but we struggled for a whole three days. The main roads were swarming with refugees, various suspicious individuals and certainly also the bishop's and Hussite spies. We deemed it better to stay off the road and remain in seclusion, so that Hynek wouldn't reveal himself by any chance. Even though it would certainly be his sauciness or fierce temper that would have been to blame for such a chance.<br><br>At first, I was worried to be travelling alongside a Hussite. But the memories of the poor Anna who is being held prisoner somewhere and of the hellish beast we'd faced together cast my doubts aside. If I'm making a mistake, I shall do penance and pay for my actions, that's for certain.<br><br>When Hynek stops being cross, he can be a fun companion. His honesty is certainly a godsent. It so happened that I revealed so much about myself to him as though we'd known one another for our entire lives. Hopefully I won't regret him knowing about my Premyslid blood, the witch who kidnapped my elder brother, or the gossip that led to my entering the monastery.
08_OnTheOtherSide_BriegFinishedJournal=Brieg's streets were barren, not a soul to be seen anywhere. At one point, a man ran off out of a side alley. Hynek called out to him but he didn't spare us even a look. The fear of the approaching Hussite army was forcing him to dash out of the town. We dismounted in front of the Dominican monastery of the Holy Cross gate.
08_OnTheOtherSide_EnterHynekJournal=Behind the gate, the sub-prior stepped in our path and didn't want to let us go on. He was claiming to be alone in the monastery because all the brethren had already fled from the incoming Hussites. He wanted to lock the place up and set off in their tracks. I was attempting to talk reason to him, but in the end, it was only Hynek and his hot-headedness that got us inside. He started threatening the frater, and he got so scared that he fled for his dear life, leaving the gate wide open. I'm not sure whether to curse or thank Hynek.
08_OnTheOtherSide_EnterJournal=Behind the gate, the sub-prior stepped in our path and didn't want to let us go on. He was claiming to be alone in the monastery because all the brethren had already fled from the incoming Hussites. He wanted to lock the place up and set off in their tracks. I'm not proud of myself but desperate situations demand desperate actions. We ran past him like a pair of naughty street orphans. When I looked back, I saw the frater walking outside the gate and locking us up inside, shaking his head. We ended up all alone in the deserted monastery.
08_OnTheOtherSide_NoEnterJournal=Behind the gate, the sub-prior stepped in our path and didn't want to let us go on. We had no choice but to leave the monastery. There was no dissuading the frater. He then locked the gate, bid farewell to us and set off to follow the other Dominicans. There's no choice but to get inside another way. Joachim Weinhard may still be in there somewhere.
08_OnTheOtherSide_HoleEnterJournal=We found a hole in the wall behind a dense thicket on the western side of the monastery, and thus found ourselves a way to where the sub-prior refused to let us in. Hopefully this means that God favors us and will keep standing with us.
08_OnTheOtherSide_PursuitJournal=Out of nowhere, he turned up. The treacherous priest Joachim Weinhard walked out of the main building's door, and the moment he glimpsed us, he set off running.
08_OnTheOtherSide_DeadEndJournal=We caught up to him in an underground crypt used as an ossuary and we wanted to hear him out, but he merely mocked us. He then used a certain spell that reanimated the bones that had been stored there for their eternal rest, and ran away. The skeletons attacked us. We fended them off, moving deeper underground in Weinhard's tracks. We'd lost him in a black chapel with a strange organ. I quickly discovered a hidden passageway but it was not easy to figure out a mechanism that would open it. I tried to combine the organ tones, and in the end it worked out well. I feel I'm getting more and more entangled in a struggle that reaches far beyond anything I'd been able to imagine until recently. It warms my heart to know that Weinhard believed in our death so much that he let us in on where he was headed – to the Cistercians in Kamenz. And he even mentioned that Lilith and my sister Anna would be expecting him there. Beloved Anna, may God protect her soul and may we meet one another soon again.
08_OnTheOtherSide_PursuitFinishedJournal=We were wandering through the underground and searching for where the warlock had eluded us to. We were examining the cellars, and in the end we suddenly walked straight into a church full of Hussites. They were burning the pews and paintings, and amidst all the desolation, there was a tied up Weinhard lying on the floor. The Hussites had overpowered him. Instead of welcoming Hynek back like a lost brother, they accused him of treason and ordered to have him strung up alongside the warlock. Hynek gave me a quick shout to flee. I do not know whether I did the right thing. I put my sister's life above all else, but it was Hynek who was protecting me down there in the underground with his sword, and I then didn't repay him with the same coin. I hope he will be able to convince his brethren of his innocence, for theirs is the motto „Truth prevails“.
08_OnTheOtherSide_HussitesJournal=I left the Brieg town behind. I'm now heading for the monastery in Kamenz. If God wills, I may save my sister who was kidnapped and now is being held prisoner by the Lilith beast for unknown reasons. I'm driving the horse on so that I can get there as soon as possible but my thoughts linger with Hynek. My conscience is bothering me and I don't know whether I acted honest. I hope for him to make it out of the sticky situation in good health.

09_UsAgainstUs_IntroJournal=The town and the buildings of the monastery were burnt to the ground and I was taken by my brethren to a nearby encampment at Olawa. It was impossible to reason with them at all, as if they weren't listening to me or were bewitched. They kept saying I was a traitor and would be hanged. As proof that the world had really turned to shit, they put me in a single cage with that infernal turd Weinhard. I hope at least Lothar saved himself. He may be standing on the wrong side and a bit of a biscuit to boot, but somehow he's grown on me.
09_UsAgainstUs_JoachimJournal=With a little trickery, I've broken free of the handcuffs and even managed to get some facts out of the slimy turd. He finally confided quite willingly. I guess he understood that Lilith had thrown him overboard and he was drowning in shit. I'll sum it up quickly - I hope I'm not going to make a fool out of myself if a stranger reads this:<br><br>Lilith was sent to our world by the Devil himself. She is said to have come through a passage hidden under the Devil's Mountain (how fitting!) to prepare the way for the arrival of his infernal hordes in our realm. She was to search for an ancient stone, cursed by the wrath of God, which would help them open other passages. Circumstances led Lilith to John of Minsterberg, and as he thrust his hips hard, he must have struck a spark. The two decided that even the Devil was not eternal and it would not be a bad idea to dethrone him. Therefore, her minions, led by Weinhard, seized the Spear of Destiny in Little Oels. Yeah, Lothar was right, it's the Spear of Destiny! But since neither Lilith nor Duke John can sit on Hell's throne themselves (why, Lejnard didn't say), the demoness devised a scheme to fulfil John's desire for a son. But alas, fertility in Lilith's case is a ship that sailed long ago. So, they kidnapped Lothar's sister in order to take possession of her body. The bitch plans to drain Anna's soul and possess her body so she can conceive a son with John.<br><br>It all fits together. It wouldn't have worked with a common noblewoman, but as even Lothar revealed to me, their family has both royal and witch blood running in their veins. Anna is said to have inherited clairvoyant and magical abilities. It seems she sent the unicorn to rescue me and bring me to Lothar. I don't know what I did to deserve it, but God willing, I will do my best to repay Anna's help.
09_UsAgainstUs_DreamJournal=Weinhard luckily spilled the beans in time, because I didn't even have time to put the gag back in his mouth before the brethren showed up at the jail. Deciding not to wait until morning, they dragged him out and tied him to the wall. I can still smell the stench of burning flesh and hear his screams. I couldn't sleep, so I rather prayed that they would find a nice tree for me tomorrow so that I wouldn't have to fry in my own juice as well. Somewhere in the middle of the hundredth repetition of the Hail Mary, I must have sunk into slumber, because everything I remember then is someone screaming at me in my sleep to wake up. It was a girl, beautiful as a holy picture, but her voice was like a bell tolling in the depths of hell. Now that I know what Lothar's sister is capable of, I'd be willing to bet it was her. I opened my eyes, and there was this transparent beast drooling right in my face, all the colors of the rainbow, like when you spin a shard against the sun. When it saw me staring at it, it scurried away good and well.
09_UsAgainstUs_WakeUpJournal=I was walking through the camp trying to wake up some of the brethren. No luck. I suspect the shapeshifting creature has them in its grasp. It must have bewitched them!
09_UsAgainstUs_PatrolsJournal=Everyone's snoring far and wide. Even the ones who should be keeping watch. Why isn't the spell working on me? Is it Anna's doing, and the fact that she woke me in time?
09_UsAgainstUs_DreamDemonJournal=I watched that transparent bitch drool in another unfortunate guy's face and remembered what granny used to tell me. They say there is a demon - a nightmare that enters a person's dreams, takes over their memories and mind, and then can control them even at daytime. She also said something about mimicking, what the hell was it?
09_UsAgainstUs_LightJournal=I know now! The nightmare burrows into a person's head, and if they accidentally break free from its power and wake up, it tries to fool them by mimicking the voices and sounds from their memories. But you don't get to mess with me, you translucent fucker! I could tell too well that you were afraid of the light! All you have to do is get close to a torch, and you're whimpering and running away. I must think of a way to take advantage of that.
09_UsAgainstUs_DreamDemonKillJournal=I couldn't kill it with the sword but I finally beat it with fire. As soon as the nightmare fell to the ground, my brethren began to awaken. It didn't seem to have left any effects on them besides a good hangover. They're listening to what I say again, and they don't want to hang me anymore.
09_UsAgainstUs_FinalJournal=Thanks to the personal experience with the nightmare, the hetmans finally believed me and acknowledged that the field troops may be in danger. Prokop summoned us for a quick meeting. I had to tell him again everything that had happened to me since Hennersdorf, how I met Lothar, and what we had discovered together over the last few days. Prokop decided to leave nothing to chance and sent riders to Bohemia for reinforcements. After Sunday, we would march to Strzelin and then to Wrocław, which suits me fine. I know from Weinhard that the Clairvoyant that Lilith keeps around is supposed to be staying at the nearby fortress of Sobath. I'm sure Prokop won't mind us stopping there.

10_FamilyTies_MonasteryJournal=<i>Tuesday, March 30, 1428.</i> Between me and the monastery in Kamenz lay not only Monsterberg, but especially the scattered Hussite troops which plundered even dozens of miles away from the main army. Thanks to God's help, I haven't encountered any Hussite patrols. Nevertheless, I managed to reach my destination only on the third day, shortly past midnight. I was surprised by how calm it was there. Like a portent of something evil. I was hoping that the culprit was just my mind, still unsettled by the ordeals of the past days.
10_FamilyTies_WitchJournal=Despite the late night hour, I pounded on the monastery gate. Anna was still in danger, and I didn't want to waste precious time. It proved to be a rather unfortunate decision for me. One of the Cistercian monks opened up the gate and let me in. Immediately, other brethren came rushing in as though no one in the monastery was asleep. I should have been warned. Perhaps my words were too clumsy, or perhaps I immediately aroused their suspicions, but I can only attribute what happened to my unprecedented naivety. After all I have been through, I should have expected treason even here. One of the monks opened a trapdoor and I fell underground. My fall was softened by more than an ell's worth of stinking water. When I regained my bearings, I noticed a ripple in the water, I wasn't alone down here…
10_FamilyTies_SewerJournal=In the gloom, I could make out the outline of a figure. It moved quickly from side to side, occasionally disappearing entirely underwater. Who are the monks keeping underground and why? Is it a prisoner like me, or a creature they want to feed my flesh to? Judging by the experience of the last few days, it's more likely the latter. The creature was laughing and trying to get closer to me. It was clear it was my life that it was after. No, I shall not perish here! Who would help my sister then? I was ready to fight the beast as the walls covered with sharp spikes moved, beginning to shrink our shared space. I saved myself only with God's help! Those monks shall not get away with that. Justice is coming for them soon, but for now, I must finish what I'm here for. To find and save Anna.
10_FamilyTies_DungeonEnterJournal=I waded through the filthy water of the underground sewer until I came upon a staircase leading upward and ending in a door. I found myself in the vaults beneath the monastery. By now, I knew better than to expect any good befalling me here, yet I must explore every nook and cranny, every dungeon, every dark hiding place to see if my beloved Anna is being held prisoner here somewhere. No hellish scheming would stop me.
10_FamilyTies_CellsJournal=The monastery vault was lined with corridors, many of them littered with rows of cells. The largest jails in the country could envy this monastery. I walked through the corridors, peering behind the bars to make sure Anna wasn't being held prisoner somewhere. Yet, all I found were atrocities, deadly rot and blatant wickedness. Blood on the walls of the dungeons, hinges shattered by broken fingernails, and mutilated naked corpses of young girls on the floors. A fear has been planted into my mind that if I find my sister dead here, I may renounce God and my faith.
10_FamilyTies_SurgeryJournal=One of the passages led me to a spacious, hospital-like room. Like everywhere else, there were only female corpses even here. But no one had washed them and prepared them for a proper Christian burial. On the contrary, against God's will, they were dissected, internal organs removed, and blood drained from their veins. And some body parts were even kept in ceramic vessels.
10_FamilyTies_StorageJournal=I found a storage room filled with food, wine and other necessities for long-term survival, the quantity of which surprised me. There were other crates and barrels of supplies in the corridors of the dungeon as well. This place could hold its own against a siege.
10_FamilyTies_ObsidianFirstJournal=On the south side of the catacombs, I discovered a room with a pedestal on which was displayed a strange black stone worked into the shape of a pyramid. It may have been an obsidian, but what it was used for, I had no idea.
10_FamilyTies_ObsidianSecondJournal=I walked through the underground and found another room with a pyramid on a pedestal. It looks as though they worship it. As I approached it, I felt a similar power in it as I do before our Lord in the church. It was mighty, but it didn't lift my spirits. It was bringing me down to my knees and showing me my smallness and inadequacy. It tempted me to succumb to that power. It offered to show me the way to become better, wiser, more helpful… It was strange that I didn't feel it the first time. Perhaps one must be exposed to the pyramid for a longer period before realizing it. Hynek would say the whole thing stank of brimstone.
10_FamilyTies_SwordJournal=Using the deciphered spell, I entered a secret room. There was a magical sword with a flaming blade hidden there. I was a little worried, but when I sheathed the sword, it obediently went out and reignited when I drew it again.
10_FamilyTies_GateRoomJournal=With the help of the key, I got through the bars into an underground hall lined with statues of angels and hooded demons. I had seen and experienced a lot over the last few days, but even that had not prepared me for what I saw here. On one side of the hall, heat radiated from a gateway formed perhaps by hellfire itself, for there was nothing to feed its flame. And opposite that, a strange vessel decorated with the symbol of the Devil – a pentagram. Not even that was everything. The hall was guarded by a knight perhaps a fathom taller than me, with a horned helmet and glowing eyes. I commended my soul to God and stepped boldly forward.
10_FamilyTies_Obsidian1Journal=A sudden impulse made me place one of the obsidian stones into the vessel in the hall with the burning gate. No sooner had the stone touched the vessel than it floated up, began to spark and glow.
10_FamilyTies_Obsidian2Journal=When I inserted the second obsidian, the whole event repeated itself. Then the two stones began to move closer together, drawn to one another by an unknown force, until they merged into one piece. The surface of this new stone became covered with some kind of substance and was radiating heat.
10_FamilyTies_FinalJournal=As soon as I touched the merged stones, the fire blazing in the gateway went out and I was able to pass through to the other side. I didn't find my sister Anna there. On the contrary, I found myself facing yet another mortal peril. If the knight guarding the area in front of the gate had looked like a giant to me, then the demon hiding behind it was a monster from the Titan myths. The enormous hammer in his hands gave me a clue that I didn't want to approach him, but I had no choice, the gate had closed behind me again.
10_FamilyTies_FinalJournalFinished=No weapon would stand a chance against him, so I had to resort to trickery. I observed that the strength and massiveness of the infernal monster were at the expense of cleverness and, above all, agility. I lured him to the pillars that supported the stone ceiling, and made him swing at me. At the last moment, I dodged, and the creature's hammer knocked a pillar down. And another, and another… It didn't take long for the ceiling to start collapsing. When all the pillars fell down, I leapt to the edge but it was too late. I was caved in, just like the demon. Darkness had befallen my eyes and I lost consciousness.<br><br>I was awakened by sunlight and voices. I could feel myself being pulled out from under the rubble and carried away, but my consciousness was blurry, and soon I passed out again.

11_Vision_IntroJournal=<i>Sunday, April 4, 1428.</i> Yesterday, we encamped near Reichenbach, and we are currently waiting for reinforcements from Bohemia to join us. Then we'll march on to Wrocław, with a brief stop at Sobath. I pray we get there as soon as possible. The rescue of Lothar's sister Anna has become not only a matter of my honor and debt to Lothar, but now my life depends on it as well. Every time I fall asleep, I dream of Anna. She is summoning me to Sobath, crying that she is being held prisoner there, violently rattling the bars and screaming so desperately that it wakes me up immediately. I haven't slept properly for a week. I don't think I can take much more of this.
11_Vision_ArrivingJournal=Just before Mass, reinforcements from Bohemia arrived at the camp. The army under John of Kaisberg numbered several thousand heads, and one of them belonged to John Kolda of Sandbach. I like that giant of a man, if only the Lord God would knock him two ells into the ground so that my back would not hurt when I talk to him. If my memory serves me right, I owe him some coins from Farkle. I hope he doesn't harp on it too much in front of his brethren.
11_Vision_JohnKoldaJournal_Intro=I met John Kolda, and he hasn't changed a bit. All jokes and nothing but fighting and gambling in his head.
11_Vision_JohnKoldaJournal_Men=The forces that joined us number three thousand men, I fear even that may not be enough and we may soon be living in interesting times.
11_Vision_JohnKoldaJournal_Soon=I found out from Kolda that Kaisberg was also anxious for a fight, and so they set out for Silesia a week before we sent for them. Kolda also boasted that he had managed to catch a hostage along the way. A nobleman for whom he hopes to get a good ransom from his family.
11_Vision_LotharJournal=I went to look at the hostage our reinforcements brought, and found out it was Lothar! We spoke briefly about the events of the last few days. I made a promise in Monsterberg to help him find his sister, and I intend to keep it. But first I am going to have to arrange for Lothar to be released.
11_Vision_DiceJournal=Lothar thought I might just win him in Farkle from Kolda. I wanted to explain to him that gambling was a sin, of course, but I don't know what that fake Pope of theirs preaches. So, I let it go and decided that the ends justify the means. I just have to figure out where to get dice, because I'm sure no one in our camp would brag about owning something like that. I'm going to make some discreet inquiries.
11_Vision_FishJournal=The dice will be loaned to me by Robby the Quartermaster, whose purpose in the camp is to have everything after all, even the things that are not exactly allowed, but he wants fish in return for them. Where am I going to get some?
11_Vision_HookJournal=Straw is a skilled guy, he could catch a fish, but he doesn't have a hook or a rope. Furthermore, it's going to take something for bait. I'll have to get some earthworms as well.
11_Vision_DiceFinishedJournal=Puchala had stored up all the hooks, and he wanted nothing to do with Robby or anyone around him. He was babbling something about spoiled wine. He gave me no choice, I had to steal a hook from him. The only thing left to do was to pick the earthworms for Straw, my back still hurts. I'd worked up a good sweat, and I'd done more walking than even the worst streetwalker, but the dice from Robby are already warm in my pocket.
11_Vision_CaptivityFinishedJournal=I'm not proud of it but I won Lothar in Farkle. If he ever finds out what I put into the game, he'll regret not having stabbed me when we'd first met already. I hope Kolda doesn't boast anywhere that I promised him Lothar's sister's hand if I'd lost. The giant didn't care what she looked like, only what her dowry was.
11_Vision_MassStartJournal=Lothar is free, but of course he goes on to Sobath with us. We have about a day or two of travel ahead of us. Kolda has no time to be angry with me. He prays to the Lord to forgive him for that six-sided dotted sin of his. I pray to finally be able to get some sleep, and also for it never to be revealed that it was me who put the laxative in the wine. I don't know who would kill me first then, the shit-covered Puchala or the falsely accused Robby. As far as I'm concerned, God's ways are unfathomable, and the wine was necessary for the good of the cause.
11_Vision_ArmyJournal=<i>Tuesday, April 6, 1428.</i> A two-day journey is nothing to get me down, but dreams of Anna make me unable to sleep and every part of me is aching. No sooner do I wake up than Anna calls to me in my dreams, screaming for help. If we don't find her at Sobath, it will be the end of me. Kolda went ahead with a small party to take over the keep. I suspected it wouldn't be so easy but the giant would not be talked out of it.
11_Vision_ArmyFinishedJournal=When we caught up with them, they were no more successful in conquering the keep than I was in my sleep. A beast had taken up residence at Sobath, and since the brethren couldn't deal with it even after several attempts, Kolda sent for the cannons. He wants to blow the keep up. We can't allow for that. What if Anna is really imprisoned there? Prokop has let Lothar and me confront what had already killed a dozen brethren there by ourselves. I trust the Lord to help us.
11_Vision_JohnKoldaJournal=Kolda didn't like our deal with Prokop, and he wasn't about to admit that we might succeed where his men had failed. At last, he gave us time until sunset. Then the cannons would start firing. My gut feeling is telling me that I would rest tonight. I just hope it's not going to be the eternal kind of rest.
11_Vision_BasiliskJournalFinished=In the courtyard of the keep, a basilisk was waiting for us. My granny had told me stories of these beasts several times when I was a child. I'd loved her scary stories, but I hadn't known I would ever actually experience them. I knew right away that Kolda's men couldn't stand a chance against it. Few people know how to take it on. I warned Lothar that he mustn't look it in the eye, and he must be careful of the poison the beast spits. Lothar and I are becoming one hell of a team. It took a lot of work but we managed to take the beast out. Now all we have to do is go get the princess in the tower.
11_Vision_TowerJournalFinished=Our journey inside the keep was made harder by another gate, secured from the other side. We bested it with the help of Kolda's men and a battering ram. I managed to deal with the broken tower bridge by myself, as well as the rotten door. The tower opened for us.
11_Vision_ClairvoyantJournal=We found an old man upstairs. I think he was that Clairvoyant of Lilith's. He was babbling confusedly, and before we could question him properly, he poisoned himself.
11_Vision_AnnaJournalFinished=We rescued Anna, our sister. Yes, I'm their kidnapped older brother. An offended witch, yeah, that's fitting for granny. And at last, what she said about common blood with Jobst of Luxembourg made sense as well. Lothar did mention he was of the Premyslid bastard family. But there was no time for big talk. Anna just quickly explained how it was with the Clairvoyant, and then immediately wanted to talk urgently with Prokop the Shaven. I wonder what about. She sent Lothar to the top floor of the tower to get invisibility potions. She said they'd be needed.
11_Vision_Finale=<i>Wednesday, April 7, 1428.</i> He who has a lot can lose a lot. Wandering the world alone meant thinking only of myself, worrying about no one. I still can't believe that Lothar and Anna are really my siblings but it seems to be true. I lost them again today but hopefully only for a few days. They have gone to Wrocław to plead with the Bishop Konrad and the nobles of the land to have their men join us in the upcoming battle against the evil. We will await them at Devil's Mountain, the place from where Hell is about to enter our world and take over the souls of all Christians. I pray that we be able to face the darkness squarely, that our fears not weaken us, that we manage to look death right in the eye and rise to arms. Not only in the name of the Lord but especially in the name of life.

12_LastBattle_IntroJournal=<i>Friday, April 9, 1428.</i> Two days ago, Anna and I left Hynek and the Hussite encampment to persuade Bishop Konrad and the Silesian lords to send their troops to Jawor. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I feared that they would laugh at us, but Anna can be very persuasive, and strange things began to happen all over Silesia. People are disappearing in the towns. Some vanish completely, others are found after a while as mutilated, partially chewed up corpses. Guards had to be posted around cemeteries because graves are opening and skeletal remains are scrambling up to the surface. The wicked began to appear in town squares, announcing the arrival of the Antichrist and recruiting new followers to the ranks of Devil's worshippers. There is not much news from the countryside, where the eyes of the authorities can hardly see at all, and I have heard only in passing that some lords have lost many a servant and that all sorts of vermin, unknown to men, are said to be roaming the woods. The hidden evil began to surface, and thus there was no one in Wrocław who would not believe us.<br><br><i>Friday, April 16, 1428.</i> It has been nine days since I last met Hynek. I left Anna in the safety of the city walls, and the army we had raised with the permission of the bishop and the Silesian lords set off for Devil's Mountain.
12_LastBattle_BattlefieldJournal=<i>Monday, April 19, 1428.</i> We were less than a mile away from the Hussites when the sky became clouded with flame and blood, and the landscape began to disappear in a mist. In the distance, I heard the sound of cannons. The battle had begun, and we were late. I left our ranks and rode forward. Fear for my brother made me urge my horse on, and the message I brought him from Anna could not be delayed.
12_LastBattle_BattlefieldFinishedJournal=I ran around the battlefield looking for Hynek. I was horrified to find that in some places, the undead had already broken through the wagon fort and gotten behind it. The heat of the battle made my search difficult, but eventually, with God's help, I succeeded and found my brother safe.
12_LastBattle_CaveFinishedJournal=I entrusted Hynek with Anna's vision. Lilith had found the Stone of God's Wrath, and together with John, armed with the Spear of Destiny, she wants to kill the Devil, open the remaining gates of Hell, and release more undead into this realm. Once they succeed, humanity is done for. Their plans could be thwarted by the Clairvoyant, but if the powerful artifacts fall into the Devil's greedy clutches, all our efforts will be for naught. The final battle cannot be fought by knights of the Order, the bishop's ranks nor Hussite field troops. Only by my brother and me. With the help of the invisibility potion, we have made our way to the cave where we must find the gates of Hell and enter Hell itself.
12_LastBattle_IllusionsJournal=Lilith, or perhaps the Devil himself, had set up a trap to lead us astray and discourage us. But I was guided by faith and none of the traps stopped us. They were only illusions, left here for the foolish and the weak of faith.
12_LastBattle_TrialsJournal=The trials escalated. Hell, desperate as it was, was attacking our primal instincts. Shameless maidens tried to lure us into fornication, treasure chests were meant to awaken our lust for wealth. I was not fooled even for a moment. Hynek was but for a moment.
12_LastBattle_HellGateJournal=Despite all odds, we managed to reach the very depths of the cave, all the way to Hell's gate. There we caught up to Lilith and John of Monsterberg, this time engaged in some sort of ritual. I don't know if it was related to the influx of the undead in the above world, or if they were using it to help themselves penetrate the inner circle of Hell, but our presence, like the first time, took them quite by surprise. And just like the first time, they tried to kill us. While we fought off their minions, they disappeared into the burning gates of Hell.
12_LastBattle_HellGateFinishedJournal=We defeated the creatures that Lilith and John had set upon us, and then walked into Hell after them.

13_NoWayBack_IntroJournal=I entered the portal and tried not to think about what happened to me the last time I did that. Back then, I got hit in the head and woke up in the oubliette. Today was only slightly better. I didn't find Lothar, John nor Lilith on the other side. I found myself alone, and it was clear where… The stench of brimstone, the wailing of suffering souls, and blazing heat like in a forge. Welcome to Hell, Hynek.
13_NoWayBack_FindDevilJournal=Hell welcomed me in a proper manner. Sinners were crawling on the ground and burning in bright flames. Human flesh was boiling in the cauldrons. And devils were impaling the groaning wretches with pitchforks and abusing them in a thousand ways. They'd like to do the same to me as well but I beat them head on. With the help of some infernal rocks, I got through the fiery gates, but when a demon huge as a mountain got in my way, I was done for. Luckily, Lothar appeared from somewhere, and together we finished the beast off. I guess that caught the Devil's attention. He's brought us to his throne and he looks pretty pissed.
13_NoWayBack_GodStoneFinishedJournal=The audience with the Lord of Hell didn't go so well. For him. The Devil may have known that John of Monsterberg was going to kill him with the Spear of Destiny, but he had no idea that only one gate of Hell was open and his hordes were not conquering the world. Then Lilith and her lover appeared, equipped with magical artifacts, intent on carrying out the infernal coup. To make a long story short… not only did we thwart them, but we got our hands on both the Stone of God's Wrath and the Spear of Destiny as well.
13_NoWayBack_HellArmyFinishedJournal=The Devil would have liked to have had his way with us and kept the artifacts, but Lothar got down on his knees and started praying with the stone of God in his hands. Heaven itself rushed to our aid. A strong light dazzled me, and when I came to again, I was back on the battlefield. There was no sign of the Devil's hordes, and many confused men were milling around. God had driven the hellions back underground and taken away the memories of the battle and its causes from all the men who had participated in the fight with Hell. Only me, Lothar and the Monsterberg shithead knew what had happened. The Duke, of course, waited for nothing, dashed off and stumbled back to his castle, cowering in fear. The Stone of God's Wrath crumbled to dust in Lothar's hands, but what we were going to do with the Spear of Destiny, I had no clue…<br><br>We found ourselves on opposite sides of the barricade again. The two armies had quickly regrouped and were threatening to engage each other. Fortunately, the crusader prior came to his senses and called for a retreat.
13_NoWayBack_FinalJournal=I still hold the ideals of my brethren in my heart but I no longer intend to spread them by the sword. I met Prokop to tell him I was leaving but we quarreled and parted on bad terms. He might have understood me if he had not forgotten all that had happened before and during the battle of Devil's Mountain. Now I'm going to Reichenstein to help Anna and Lothar with the castle repairs. And what next? I'm drawn to an old friend of mine, hopefully she won't mind that my hair has thinned a bit since we last met.

Be wary of her, because she is the one bearing the magical power which she lends to her successors.<br><br>Blissful <b>Ishtar</b> will brush past her companions and offer the dark lord the most secret pleasures of the physical world which are known only to her, the patroness of prostitutes and the creator of orgies.<br><br>With her four arms, <b>Kali</b>, a she-daemon of blue skin, spins the wheel of time and looks out for deaths of those who are going to the realm of the dark lord, so that she may direct their steps there.

Daemonicon3_Text=There are caves where thou shalt find pits with no bottom. Along them are paintings left for us by forgotten beings who lived here centuries before us.

It is not necessary for the altars to be made of human remains, the bones of animals shall suffice, however, the human ones give more power to our supplications.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>In order to invoke <i>Abaddon</i> and cast his wrath upon our enemies, we need to proceed as follows.<br><br>First, we toss a mare into the pit. This will cause <i>Abaddon</i> to notice us.<br><br>Once the roar of the falling horse has permanently subsided, we toss all the valuables we possess into the pit. This causes <i>Abaddon</i> to spread his wings.<br><br>Finally, we toss a dozen children into the pit, no need for them to be our own, and once their cries have died down, <i>Abaddon</i> hears our wishes. <br><br>Now we must call out the names of those we wish doom upon.<br><br>Then we need only wait until the echoes die away and doom befalls our enemies.

BookEdelsteinCastle=About The Edelstein Castle
BookEdelsteinCastle_Text=At the foot of the Bishop Mound lies the picturesque town of Zuckmantel which is surrounded by tall mountains from the South, East and Southwest, and which offers a beautiful view of Silesia to the North.<br>On a knoll not far from Zuckmantel, the proud Edelstein castle stands. Since ancient times, deep underground hideouts of six giants, immensely huge and strong, were located where the walls of Edelstein now stand.<br>These underground giants murdered neighboring villagers and ate their flesh. Travellers would add several hours to their journey and take a different route rather than risk coming close to this infamous place. There didn't seem to be any end to the kidnappings and murders and the locals decided it was better to leave and find new homes in safer places.<br>The giants soon noticed this and hard times fell upon them. Travelers preferred making their way through deep woods rather than getting caught and eaten by them. So the giants conferred with one another and decided to build a big castle with a tall tower on one of the hills, from which they could see far in all directions. That way, they would easily spot any poor person even far in the distance, and catching them would become easier and surer.<br>Within several days, they had a strong castle constructed, with a tower which can still be seen today by travelers. Now the giants plundered even more terribly than before and did so for over a hundred years more. Then suddenly, the attacks ceased and the giants disappeared without a trace. No one knew what happened to them but there has been peace in the area ever since. Soon after they vanished, people started coming back, establishing the settlements that are still here today.

BookRedMine_Text=<b>About the Red Mine</b><br><br>Year of the Lord 1424. The day before the remembrance of Saint Anthony, that is the sixteenth day of the month Ianuarius, a terrible accident took place in the mines of Lady Anna of Reichenstein and Bishop Konrad in Wrocław, Duke of Oels and Nysa. These two, along with the entire principality, suffered a big loss when they lost some fifty miners who were called to go to the Lord after the big tragedy.<br><br>Witnesses to the accident say that the miners were lighting a candle as usual, in order to be able to see their craft well under the ground, when suddenly a large bang could be heard. Everyone in the lowest tunnels either burned alive, or was buried under the rubble and suffocated. Some delirious persons claimed that even two days later, they could hear the cackle of devils from the place, as they stole the souls of the poor miners from God and took them to Hell.<br><br>Since then the mines, called Red, are filled in and none of the old surviving miners, or the new young ones, haven't dared pick up their tools and return glory to the place. While devils haunt the place, no godly person will go near it.

I altered or added nothing.</i></size><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>In the jungles of a southern land, the native inhabitants showed me an animal similar to a horse, with a brown body and a white-striped backside. Using its extremely long tongue it ate leaves from trees, and the males had small antlers on their heads, almost a span in length. But those didn't seem as odd to me as their bluish hooves.<br><br>Far in the East in a sand-covered land, I came across legends of a giant worm. The locals discouraged me from encountering it due to its dangerousness. Apparently it spits poison and can burn a man to a crisp without a single touch. I lay in wait for a long time, but when it finally seemed to be approaching, my guides appeared and dragged me away.<br><br>The wild Scotsmen told me of their ancestors, the much feared blue warriors, but had no evidence to prove their existence. So they showed me the monster of theirs at least. Its neck was as long as the mast of a ship, and beneath the water's surface, they said, it had four legs that resembled fins and a tail. The waves it caused were enough for me, and I had no desire to see its body anymore.<br><br>On the way to Venice, I took part in a hunt for a beast which was killing people and cattle alike. I thought it would be a lone wolf but in the end we captured an animal three times the size of a wolf, with fangs as long as my index finger! Its fur was golden and long and thick around its neck.

And when she had molested, he bade her drown the child in the pond, but she would not.<br>They got into a quarrel, and Odol the groom put the newborn in a sack and wanted to bury it in the orchard. She resisted him, but Odol dipped the sack into a tub of water and thus killed the baby.

She is to be put to death by the executioner before burial.</i></size> <br><br><b>On the sixth day of the new year 1428</b>, Mary of Neuhof was rightfully interrogated under judicial torture. She was first ordered to speak voluntarily of her deeds, but she remained silent. She then confessed that she had regularly lain with the Devil at the full moon, worshipped him and performed all sorts of unholy tricks in his name.<br> She had bewitched three cows of the landowner at Brucaliz. Then they stopped milking and one of them died foaming at the mouth. Last year at Pentecost, she brought such a blizard and hailstorm to make the town of Monsterberg and the whole area miserable. The neighbours who suspected her of witchcraft were hexed by her, and each of them died within three days. However, her greatest blame is for having cast an itchy rash and diarrhea on the priest of Monsterberg to prevent the celebration of Mass. <br><br>Mary of Neuhof shall be set on the stake at dawn of the morrow and burned as a witch. <br><br><b>On the Friday after St. Dorothy in the summer of 1428</b> Adalbert of Lhottka was questioned by the master executioner, and he testified, even without being subjected to judicial torture, that he had carried away half a bucket of oats on the threshing-floor of old Eugenia, and then he was stealing from the village fields, having carried away three buckets of rye. In the tavern he had found himself some buddies, and with them he was going to the barns and stealing further. He would then take the stolen grain to the market in the wagon of Andrew the farmhand, and sell it in seclusion to avoid those who might recognise him. How much they took in total he does not know, for he poured everything he had earned down his throat, and his mind is so darkened by the frequent drinking that even the art of a master executioner could not have restored it.<br><br>It is not possible to question his buddy Andrew, as Adalbert quarreled with him last Sunday in the pasture near Black Forest and smashed his head with a stick. Adalbert has confessed to this also without torture, and it shall be imputed to him.<br><br>Adalbert shall be denounced and punished with ten strokes of the executioner's cane. He shall then be taken on a cart to the gallows hill and punished by hanging from the neck in front of his neighbours.<br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>.

They are like our rulers, but at the age of thirteen, they must make a sacrifice for us and for <b>Baphomet</b>.<br><br>At night when even the moon cannot be seen and the stars are covered beneath a blanket of darkness, the sacrifice must be sent into the woods and each of <b>Baphomet's</b> acolytes must join the  hunt.<br><br>Barbaric as it may seem, it is the sole and proper way to invoke the true God who shall grant us victory over our enemies and false gods.<br><br>May <b>Baphomet</b> linger with us, and may the kingdom of heaven await us all.
BookAlchemy1=The Secrets of Alchemy, Volume I.
BookAlchemy1_Text=This is how sulphur, which causes all things in alchemy and on earth, begins to be made. Take two handfuls of fool's gold and wash it in pure water, and dry it in the moonlight.<br>Then put it in a goldsmith's crucible, cover it, and set it on hot coals. Keep it in intense heat for half a day. Fill the mortar half way with the urine of a healthy six-months-old infant, and pour all the fool's gold into it to soften it.<br>Take a pestle and crush it, and when thou have crushed it well, decant the urine and rinse it. Then rub the fool's gold with another pestle, a little at a time, until it dissolves in the urine. The better thou rub, the more thou gain. Therefore, don't be lazy about the rubbing.<br>Pour all the rubbed gold into a saucepan, pour the urine over it to the brim, and cook it, stirring it well with a wooden spoon so that the mixture does not shrink. Boil it and decant the dirt. It will leave with the urine a plenty. Don't mind it, pour in more urine and boil again, stir and then decant again. Do this until thou see that thou are decanting clean urine.<br>Then stop and pour lukewarm water into the pan. Then decant the water and put what is left in the pan on a hot, nigh boiling stove so that it dries out and no moisture remains. That's how thou get sulphur.
BookAlchemy2=The Secrets of Alchemy, Volume II.
BookAlchemy2_Text=Thus begins the preparation of pure gold from impure gold. Take three parts of vitriol, the same of saltpeter, and one part of ammonia. Mix all this together, pour it into a retort, and place an alembic on the retort to distil. Make sure the gap between the alembic and the retort is well oiled so that steam cannot escape from there. Place a container at the outlet of the alembic into which the distillate will flow. <br>Put the entire compound into a furnace and start a small fire beneath it.<br>When thou see the water flowing out, add a little fire and let it distil. When the distillation is done, turn up the fire very rapidly so that vapour comes out of the alembic like a mist over water. Wait until the alembic turns white. Then stop and remove the container.<br>Take a pinch of impure gold, put it in the container with water, seal it and heat the container over the coal. So shall thy water let the gold in. Then take the water with the gold, pour it into a small cauldron, and set it over the fire. When thou see the gold sink to the bottom, stop stirring, and let the cauldron cool down. Drain the water, pour in more water, and boil again. Do this five times. Then pour it all into a pan and dry the water over the coals, so that only dust remains. Pour the dust into a goldsmith's crucible and set it in the fire to calcine well. Then thou shalt have pure gold ready.
BookAlchemy3=The Secrets of Alchemy, Volume III.
BookAlchemy3_Text=This is how the preparation of the ceremonial stone, which combines the four elements, begins.<br>Water in the form of quicksilver, earth in the form of gold, fire in the form of sulphur, and the winds in the form of ammonia. And all these four elements have the same essence.<br>There is no mistake that could be made in preparing this masterpiece if you are careful. Take sixteen parts of quicksilver, two parts of sulphur, and a part or part and a half of gold. Pour all this into an earthen bowl and rub it for three hours.<br>Then pour it into a glass vial, for its neck is long and thin and it is bulbous underneath like a sphere. Place the vial on the sand in the furnace. Leave it open, so that the moisture may come out of it, and keep a gentle fire under it for four days and four nights, so that your stone may blend well.
BookAlchemy4=The Book of Shadows
BookAlchemy4_Text=Thus begins the preparation of the magic ointment that makes the flight to the sabbath possible. Take a virgin cucumber, or durian, two parts dry or four parts freshly picked. Rub this on a rock until but dust remains.<br>Then put it into a saucepan and pour holy water, or water stolen from a church, over it. Put the pan on hot coal and cook it for an hour and a half. If your herbs are not dried but freshly picked, rub and cook them in the water for two hours.<br>Then pour the water into a new saucepan, remove the dirt, put the saucepan on hot coal, and stir it with a wooden spoon so that it does not stick burned to the bottom. Let all the water vaporize so that merely dust remains.<br>Mix this dust with a spoonful of black-goose fat and leave it alone for five days and five nights. Then melt the fat and strain it.<br>Keep the fat in an earthen jar in the dark. And keep it well hidden, for it lures both infants and cattle. Take out the ointment on the day it is needed and rub it into your mouth, anus and vulva in the attic or backyard. And do not forget to anoint the birch broom on which you will fly to the sabbath, so that it may give you new ointment as you fly. And so your preparations for the sabbath are complete.
BookWitches=Concerning Witches
BookWitches_Text=There are cursed houses in whose veins magic flows along with blood, and there is no choice but to purify all the descendants of these houses in the flames of the stake and send their souls, cleansed of all sin, to the lord. For if they multiply, notwithstanding the dilution with new blood, it avails nothing, and in the generations to come, either in all or in every other, one or more women gifted with sorcery will be born. It is only women, whom God has made weak, that the curse concerns, for their souls have been tempted to sin since the beginning of the world.<br>Protect yourself and your sons from women with red hair, full lips, and beautiful shape, for such most often breed the corrupt blood of witches. And when thy heart is set on such, watch out lest she look towards the full moon, or go out of the house at night. If thou suspect that thy wife is a witch, search the house for witch's ointment, and let her not go near the fire or a broom, and banish her from thy bed. And if she creeps into thy bed, bring her to the church at once, for a woman's lust is the greatest sign of witchcraft, no matter the colour of her hair. Likewise, get rid of your daughters and your sons, and look for a wife one more time.<br>Thou may keep only such a son who kneels daily in church, gives out his heart to God only, and lies down with prayer on his lips. Such may be spared from magical raids because he is pleasing to God, but he must pledge himself wholly to the Lord and never beget children. Thou shalt renounce thy son, though he be the firstborn, if he be of a violent nature, and if he be attracted to low things, such as excessive feasting and booze. Such is promised to a witch from birth, and his blood shall lead him to a similar female as his mother was, or worse, which I have no pleasure in writing about. <i>Kknow, though, that there are worse beasts of Hell in our world who take the form of beautiful women.</i>
BookHellGate=Concerning the cursed stones
BookHellGate_Text=After the battle that took place in the heavens between Devil in the form of a dragon and archangel Michael, evil in the form of a dragon was cast down and bound in the depths of the earth.<br><br>The fall threw many stones out of earth, and they then plunged back into the depths of the ground. <br><br>These stones have the power to open the gates of Hell, behind which the fallen angel Lucifer was imprisoned.<br><br>The ambassadors of Hell have sought them many times to serve their master, to release the hordes of Hell among people, and to subdue the whole earth to him. For nothing is evil enough for the Devil, and he wants to spread his power among men, to lead them to sin, and to feed greedily on their bodies and their debauched souls.<br><br>If you find such a stone, hide it on the holiest ground, in a church or monastery under the altar where Mass is celebrated, so that prayers may cover its power and Hell may never learn of its existence. For every stone of God's wrath that is found on earth attracts the Devil with its power, and his minions seek to conquer it.
BookHellThrone=How to Ascend the Throne of Hell
BookHellThrone_Text=Thou who art holding this tome, unrestrained by moral laws, seeking the truth and the power hidden within it, know that there is not only this one dragon, the fallen angel, who is called the Devil, for his life is not eternal, and from him mankind has learned the passing of name, fortune and power from father to firstborn son. And in the same way you can usurp his throne of Hell and make yourself the supreme ruler of evil, vice and sin, if you do the following.<br>Find a wife who is devoted to Hell and who delights in power and sin, who is of a demonic nature, a cursed witch, a monster despised by men, twisted in body and temper, or who feeds on flesh or blood of men. <br>Submit her to yourself, so that she loves you more than the evil to which she belongs.<br>Commit sin and fornication with her day and night, so that you make her womb fruitful with your seed, for he who is not connected by bloodline to Hell through the son in the belly of the devilish bitch cannot sit on the throne of Hell, as his sinfulness is not perfect. <br>The last and most difficult ordeal is to obtain the weapon with which you impale your enemy on the throne of Hell. Only such one, stained with the blood of the son of God, has the power to kill the inhuman being who stands in your way to the throne. And here, many of your predecessors have lost hope of successfully completing this endeavor.
BookNightDemons=About the Beasts of the Night
BookNightDemons_Text=The rumours of woe, terror and nightmare demons are all based on truth and should not be taken lightly. It is hardly possible to distinguish which of the beasts is involved, but it is not necessary to know, for the manifestations of and the solutions to their attack are usually similar.<br><br>As a rule, they withdraw to places where many people crowd and violence is abundant. You cannot drive them away with a sincere prayer, for you would have to say it in a dream. When awake, these creatures of the night seldom attack you, but if you are already possessed by them, a sincere prayer cannot be uttered by your lips, and a priest cannot protect you. <br><br>If you suspect that one of these beasts has sat on your chest in your sleep, seek out a mage, a witch, or at least a warrior who knows much about the dark powers, for only a soul marked by magic can deal with such nocturnal vermin and rid you of them.<br><br>I can tell no more, for I have sworn an oath not to divulge the secrets of how to fend off the woes, terrors and nightmares. But remember that the longer you are exposed to their power, the more they will control your actions even at daytime. And thus do not hesitate to seek help!
BookClairvoyance=About the Art of Clairvoyancy
BookClairvoyance_Text=A person endowed with the art of clairvoyancy often comes from cursed families or from a lineage into which magical blood has been mixed.<br>If not cultivated, their abilities may manifest themselves in the form of uncontrollable and unrestrained outbursts in moments of fear or danger to the clairvoyant. A clairvoyant who has been made aware of their faculty from birth and has been properly guided and educated in its use may deepen their skill to the point of seeing into others' minds, materializing non-existent beings, or reading the future with great accuracy. <br>Such gifted individuals have often been held by powerful men of the worldly nobility or persons endowed with strong and dark magic, who have sought to improve their own abilities through the use of the clairvoyant.<br>A clairvoyant who does not know how to use their abilities commits all sorts of seemingly random and incomprehensible acts. They may appear to their loved ones in their dreams, cry or ask for help, because at daytime, while awake, their soul is bound by rationality and they cannot ask for help until they accepts their power.<br>Cases are also known where the clairvoyant unwittingly protected a loved one when they were suffering, or otherwise came to their aid. A clairvoyant must never be prevented from developing and using what is their, lest it inevitably leads to their end. Either they would take their own life, or their mind would fall into madness.

Intro_Narrator_V_06=In these hard times, people are turning to the Church for solace.
Intro_Narrator_V_07=But Church dignitaries, instead of tending to their own souls and those of their flock, are living in lavish luxury, selling indulgences, and amassing possessions. Despite proclaimed vows of celibacy, they often keep concubines and advance their own illegitimate children.
Intro_Narrator_V_08=Neverending conflicts between secular and church powers culminate in the appointment of two popes. Both of them are unequivocally convinced of their own legitimacy.
Intro_Narrator_V_09=Religious storms are starting to ravage Europe. Preachers and scholars criticize the moral decay of the Church.

Intro_Narrator_V_15=Following the death of his brother, Sigismund of Luxembourg is to be crowned the king of Bohemia. The Hussites, however, blame him for the death of Jan Huss and insist that he first accepts their reformation demands.
Intro_Narrator_V_16=But Sigismund refuses to accept these conditions and travels to Wrocław, where he begins to prepare a crusade.
Intro_Narrator_V_17=The Hussites gradually conquer Catholic castles and towns in Bohemia and, to the surprise of entire Europe, they are victorious against all crusades against them as well.
Intro_Narrator_V_18=Then they go on the offensive.
Intro_Narrator_V_19=At the beginning of the year 1428, they storm into Silesia through the Moravian Gate.

01_03_2a_Hussite_V_Torch=Here you go. Take these torches… Spread the red rooster to other houses as well…
01_03_Hynek_V_CrossExamine=God be praised!
01_03_Hynek_V_WagonExamine=Nice wagon. If we can't fit everything into our own wagons, we could hitch a horse to it and take it with us.

01_03_3_Divis_V_GodWill3=But for two things they shall be justly punished, because they have thought not well of God, giving heed to idols, and have sworn unjustly, in guile despising justice.
01_03_3_Priest_V_GodWill3=Stay away from me, you creature! Do not touch me!
01_03_3_Divis_V_GodWill4=For it is not the power of them, by whom they swear, but the just vengeance of sinners always punisheth the transgression of the unjust.
01_03_3_DobesPuchala_V_Inspect=Brother Hynek, take your people, get the horses and go there. If the bishop's people are coming from the west, we must be prepared.
01_03_3_Hynek_V_Inspect=Maybe it's the soldiers of Edelstein castle. The devil knows how much of crew Konrad left there.
01_03_3_DobesPuchala_V_Inspect2=Just take a look and come right back. We'll finish up here in the meantime and get ready to march.
01_03_3_Hynek_V_Understood=Understood.

01_05_Divis_V_LostInCave1=God protect us! What kind of sorcery was that?
01_05_Slama_V_LostInCave2=It closed itself! We have to find a different way!
01_05_Hynek_V_LostInCave2=No! Go back to Puchala. Tell him what happened! Bring the others here.
01_05_Slama_V_LostInCave3=Alright! But be careful, Hynek!

01_05_Hynek_V_Bats=Fucking hell!
01_05_Hynek_V_Bats2=That startled me!
01_05_Hynek_V_Lost=Where the hell does this lead?
01_05_Hynek_V_Lost2=I have no idea where I am.
01_05_Hynek_V_Lost3=Haven't I already been here? I feel like I'm going in circles.
01_05_Hynek_V_Lost4=This way or that one?
01_05_Hynek_V_Lost5=Damned maze!
01_05_Hynek_V_StrangeLights1=What kind of strange lights are those? Should I go toward them?

01_05_Hynek_V_CaveAmbush=Damn it…
01_05_Hynek_V_CaveAmbush1=Who are you? Whom do you serve?
01_05_Servant_V_CaveAmbush2=You shouldn't have come here, Hussite! Now you will die!
01_05_Hynek_V_CaveAmbushEnd=Alright, alright… Where is that last scoundrel?

He's got everything prepared already, and his flock shall follow him obediently. Both the locals as well as the ones from Petersdorf attend his sermons, and he has them entirely under his control. Take everyone to the cave and burn the villages down. The Hussites are nearby, so they shall become the ones to be blamed. When you return, we'll talk about your upcoming tasks. Do not disappoint me!<br><br>                           Hans von Czirn
01_06_AccessibilityLevelDescription=You are in the area under the cave. Most of the walls are made of worked stone.
01_06_AccessibilityLevelDescriptionMain=There is a rope bridge in the middle of the spacious area, and you can see levers on the walls.

01_06_Hynek_V_Handles=What are the levers used for?

01_06_Hynek_V_Storage=Is anything useful here?
01_06_Hynek_V_Door=Locked. It will need brute force.
01_06_1_FatherHerbert_V_Encounter_Hurry=Make it snappy. Take this too… Like that… Make sure it doesn't fall. What a bunch of clumsy idiots you are!
01_06_1_Villager_V_Encounter_Sorry=Forgive me, father.
01_06_1_FatherHerbert_V_Encounter_What=What was that?

01_06_2_ManInBlack_V_Portal=Father, open the portal and let's get out of here.
01_06_2_FatherHerbert_V_Portal=Yes, yes… Certainly. It will take some time…
01_06_3_PriestIncantation1=Ego aperian tenebris ad portam
01_06_3_PriestIncantation2=I'm opening the gates to darkness
01_06_3_PriestIncantation3=Accipere sacrificium meum
01_06_3_PriestIncantation4=Accept my sacrifices
01_06_2_Countdown=Time until the portal opens
01_06_2_CountdownGameover=The priest and the unknown man fled through the portal
01_06_4_FatherHerbert_V_PortalOpened=The portal is open! Damn it, he got inside! What now?
01_06_4_ManInBlack_V_IWillTakeCare=I'll take care of it. We'll meet on the other side.
01_07_AccessibilityFinalCutSub=Hynek walked out of the portal, pretty shook up. One of the dozen people around hit Hynek in the head with an iron bar. Dark.

02_01_BrotherJohn_V_Hussites=A messenger from Prior Rupert in Nysa arrived a little while ago. The Hussites are burning villages just a few miles from them.
02_01_Lothar_V_Hussites=Hmm… We'll chase them back to Moravia. It will be different this time. They are on our soil.
02_01_BrotherJohn_V_Hussites2=I don't doubt it, but it won't be an easy battle. According to spies, their army might have as many as ten thousand heads.

The Bishop of Wrocław Konrad has called a land muster and Prior Rupert ordered us to marshal the troops in Nysa. That's where we'll face the Hussites.<br><br>Don't worry about me, or about yourself. You are safe at Reichenstein. The castle is off to the side from where the Hussites are marching. And even if it came to it, the castle has strong fortifications and an experienced garrison. As soon as we win, I will be able to visit you. How long has it been? A year?<br><br>God be with you. I love you.<br><br>Your brother Lothar

02_01_BrotherAdalbert_V_LetterToAnna_Anna2Sing=Vezmu to průsmykem přes Javorník a stavím se na Reichensteinu. Už by tam snad nemělo být moc sněhu, možná jeden dva členy Rammsteinu!
02_01_Lothar_V_LetterToAnna_ThankYou=May God reward you for this.
02_01_BrotherAdalbert_V_LetterToAnna_ThankYou=I serve on a horse, while you serve with a sword in your hand. As St. Paul wrote to the Corinthians…

02_01_Lothar_V_Scriptorium_ProkopFound=And what did you find out?
02_01_Lothar_V_Scriptorium_ProkopTell=Tell me what you found out about that commander of theirs.
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_Prokop=He's an interesting person, this Prokop.
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_Prokop2=He's no farmer. When his father died, his uncle Jean de Aquis, or John of Aachen, one of the wealthiest burghers in Prague, adopted him.
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_Prokop3=Thanks to his uncle's wealth, he was able to study and often joined him on his business travels. Spain, Italy, France, and Jerusalem.
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_Prokop4=After 1420, he somehow found his way among the priests in Tabor.
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_Prokop5=He pushes for an offensive strategy and under his command, the Hussite armies have already achieved significant success. The last time in Hungary a month ago.
02_01_Lothar_V_Scriptorium_ProkopDangerous=Do you think that he's more dangerous than Zizka?
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_ProkopDangerous=Haha… No one's more dangerous than Zizka. But Prokop had time to learn a lot from him. We must not underestimate him.

02_01_Lothar_V_Scriptorium_Spies=In the records from our spies? We have spies in Bohemia?
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_Spies=Natürlich. There's always someone who prefers to be a servant to a full purse and betrays his friends. Remember Judas.

02_01_Lothar_V_Scriptorium_ProkopDontCare=Prokop? I've no interest in him.
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_ProkopDontCare=So be it. And what interests you, then, Lothar?
02_01_Lothar_V_Scriptorium_SisterAnna=Do you think that my sister Anna will be alright at Reichenstein?
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_SisterAnna=Da bin ich mir fast sicher. Reichenstein might be in the south, but in the mountains and far from places through which the Hussites are moving.
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_SisterAnna2=They are heading towards Nysa and they're busy enough with pillaging and looting along the way. They don't have time for a lengthy siege of your castle.
02_01_Lothar_V_Scriptorium_Reichenstein=Reichenstein has strong, high walls, but I can't seem to vanquish my concerns.
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_Reichenstein=I don't blame you. If we fail at Nysa, then your sister might truly be in danger.
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_Reichenstein2=Which is why we mustn't allow it. At any cost.
02_01_Lothar_V_Scriptorium_Amen=Amen.
02_01_Lothar_V_Scriptorium_Battle=How are you feeling before the battle?
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_Battle=It's not my first battle, Lothar. Or yours, either.

02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Scriptorium_End=I'll just finish reading this and then come to the courtyard.
02_01_DietmarAlzey_V_Final=Are any of the brothers late?

02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Hello=Ah, Lothar von Reichenstein. I've been awaiting you.
02_02_Lothar_V_Briefing_Silence=…
02_02_Lothar_V_Briefing_Me=You've been awaiting me?

02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Me2=You will lead a troop.
02_02_Lothar_V_Briefing_Plan=What is the plan?
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Plan=Alright. To the point.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Plan2=Sir Puota of Czastolowitz came up with a truly smart plan how to surprise the Hussites and once and for all chase them out of Silesia.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Plan3=It will require the cooperation of all lords and their companies, city garrison, as well as the Order.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Plan4=Moreover, Sir Puota had the peasants from the fields armed and trained.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Plan5=There are several thousand of them!
02_02_Lothar_V_Briefing_Plan2=Hopefully they'll be useful. What is expected of us?
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Plan6=The knights of the Order have the most important task.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Plan7=We will need to secretly enter the Hussite encampment, quietly take out the sentries and then give a signal to the infantry to attack by lighting fires.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Plan8=Select five men and immediately set off for the camp from the northeast.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Plan9=Your brothers' troops are already on the way and will hit them from three other directions.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Plan10=In the meantime, the infantry will form ranks by the gates. Here, at Bielau gate and Brigand gate. The fire will be their signal to charge.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Plan11=Remember! The most important thing is to create confusion within their ranks. The Hussites will start fleeing and the cavalry, under Mr. Puota's lead, will kill them off, with God's help.
02_02_Lothar_V_Briefing_Plan3=I understand.
02_02_Lothar_V_Briefing_Soon=Why didn't you tell us all this earlier?
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Soon=The times are hard, Lothar.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Soon2=You can't trust anyone. Only the bishop, Sir Puota who came up with it, John of Monsterberg, and I know of the plan.
02_02_Lothar_V_Briefing_You=What will you be doing?
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_You=I will join the cavalry by Sir Puota's side.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_You2=We will see each other on the battlefield.
02_02_Lothar_V_Briefing_Early=Why such an early hour?
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Early=It's what is best for the plan.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Early2=God knows this and blessed us with rain in order to conceal us from those heretics.
02_02_Lothar_V_Briefing_Early2=You could have at least warned us in advance.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Spies=We couldn't.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Spies2=The Hussites have spies everywhere. We couldn't risk the enemy finding out what we're preparing for them.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Spies3=Everyone, except the highest commanders, is only finding out now what will happen.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Spies4=That's why all the gates are guarded. Until we initiate the plan, the guards won't allow anyone in or out.

02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Necessary=Trust me, Lothar. It is.

02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Hussites2=Prokop, whom they call Shaven, had them build a wagon fort on a hillock southeast of the city.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Hussites3=Our spies report that their commanders are having what looks like a feast there.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Hussites4=Every night, they roast meat, drink, and make merry. These godless people do not even maintain a fast before Easter.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Hussites5=The rain chased them into their tents. They posted minimum guards.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Hussites6=There's nothing to wait for. Tomorrow at the latest, the Hussites will surely take the city by storm.
02_02_Lothar_V_Briefing_Hussites2=Hmm. It seems that we have a unique opportunity.
02_02_Lothar_V_Briefing_Finish=Now I know everything I needed to know.
02_02_Ruprecht_V_Briefing_Finish1=Alright. Set out immediately!

02_02_Lothar_V_ChooseDietmarYes2=Sorry, brother. The fifth in my group will be Dietmar.
02_02_Lothar_V_ChooseDietmarNo=I've already chosen.
02_02_DietmarAlzey_V_ChooseNo=As you wish. I'll go with someone else then.
02_02_NysaGuardman_V_GateClosed=The gate stays closed until we are ordered otherwise. Go away.
02_02_NysaGuardman_V_GateClosed2=Well, did you hear? Go away!
02_02_NysaGuardman_V_OpenGate=You're already here?! We have an order to open the gate for you!
02_02_NysaGuardman_V_OpenGate2=Good luck!
02_03_AccessibilityLevelDescription=You're just outside the city. There are fields and forests all around. The omnipresent fog reduces visibility.
02_03_AccessibilityHousesDescription=Around you, there are smoking ruins of houses.
02_03_AccessibilityHussiteCampDescription=You are in a Hussite camp, encircled by a wagonfort.

02_03_Lothar_V_FirstGoal2=So much destruction…
02_03_Lothar_V_SecondGoalWay=We have to leave the path here. Their camp is directly to the south.
02_03_Lothar_V_CloseCamp=It's not far at all now. I can see the fires in their camp.
02_03_Lothar_V_CloseCamp2=Careful, we don't want the sentries to spot us… Quietly.
02_03_Lothar_V_CloseCamp3=They mustn't wake up until our infantry is within sight.
02_03_Lothar_V_Camp=Strange. I would already expect sentries here.
02_03_Lothar_V_Camp2=This doesn't seem right… Oh, there's two of them there. Shhh!
02_03_Lothar_V_Infiltration1=No one's here. Where is everyone?
02_03_Lothar_V_Infiltration2=Something's not right here.
02_03_Lothar_V_Infiltration3=Where the hell are they? They should be sleeping.
02_03_Lothar_V_WrongWayOtherGroup=Not this way. We have to go more to the south, other units are coming from the East and West.
02_03_Lothar_V_WrongWayCampDeep=Better not go this deep into their encampment. They might attack us from the back.
02_03_Slama_V_Trap=Lookie here. What's this?

02_03_Lothar_V_Trap=It's a trap!

02_03_Lothar_V_RetreatRuprecht2=Damn it! That's Rupert! They pulled him off the horse. We have to save him at any cost!
02_03_Ruprecht_V_Saved=That was the last one. Thanks, brother!
02_03_Ruprecht_V_Saved2=More will be here soon. We have to retreat back to Nysa.
02_03_Ruprecht_V_Saved3=Quickly!
02_03_Ruprecht_V_NextWave=More! More of them are coming!
02_03_Ruprecht_V_NextWave2=Watch out! More heretics are on the way!
02_03_Ruprecht_V_NextWave3=Close ranks! The next group is heading straight for us!
02_03_Ruprecht_V_NextWave4=Saint Mary, mother of God, pray for us! There are more of them coming over there!
02_03_Lothar_V_RetreatCity=They're mustering themselves for an attack! They're going for the walls!
02_03_Ruprecht_V_RetreatCity=We have to get back to the city quickly.
02_03_Ruprecht_V_RetreatCity2GroupAlive=We'll separate. Lothar, send the company to St. Nicholas gate. You'll come with me and these three men to the Bielau gate!
02_03_Lothar_V_RetreatCity2GroupAlive=You heard! Run! We'll see each other later.
02_03_Ruprecht_V_RetreatCity2GroupDead=We'll separate. Lothar and three men will come with me. The rest of you go to St. Nicholas gate!
02_04_AccessibilityGateDescription=You are not far from the city gate.
02_04_AccessibilityLevelDescription=Rain and blood soak the streets of the city. Some nearby houses are on fire.
02_04_NysaGuardman_V_ClosingGate=Quickly! Come on! Behind the gate! We're closing it!
02_04_Ruprecht_V_ClosingGate=Close it!
02_04_Ruprecht_V_ClosingGate2=They're bringing a battering ram!
02_04_GameOverGate=The gate fell into the hands of the enemy
02_04_Ruprecht_V_ClosingGate3=The gate won't hold much longer. We have to get reinforcements or withdraw.
02_04_PuotaOfCzastolowitz_V_Report=Report!
02_04_NysaGuardman_V_Report=The gate is lost! It's just a matter of time! God be with us!
02_04_PuotaOfCzastolowitz_V_Report2=St. Nicholas and Brigand gates both. Delay them for as long as possible and then withdraw to the New Town walls.
02_04_NysaGuardman_V_Yes=Yes, sir!
02_04_PuotaOfCzastolowitz_V_Ruprecht=Prior? You are here? What happened?
02_04_Ruprecht_V_Incident=They pulled me off my horse while I was coming to you from the field. Lothar and his company helped me get back into the city.
02_04_PuotaOfCzastolowitz_V_Ruprecht2=You have to find shelter with the bishop and the rest of them in the safety of the castle. There's nothing you can do here.
02_04_Ruprecht_V_Provisions=And what about provisions?
02_04_PuotaOfCzastolowitz_V_Provisions=We transferred whatever we could inside the stone walls. There is no way we can save the rest.
02_04_PuotaOfCzastolowitz_V_GoodLuck=Good luck, prior!
02_04_PuotaOfCzastolowitz_V_Hyah=Hyah!
02_04_Ruprecht_V_LetsGo=Let's go, Lothar!
02_04_LittleGirl_V_Cry=Sob… sob.

02_04_Lothar_V_Cry=What's the matter, little girl?
02_04_LittleGirl_V_Mum=My… my… mommy… The Hussites broke in our house… And they want to do something to her… Help me, please…
02_04_Lothar_V_Girl_Silence=…
02_04_Ruprecht_V_Girl_Help=Show us where they are. Quickly!
02_04_LittleGirl_V_Help=This way here… Our house is around the corner.
02_04_Lothar_V_Girl_Hussites=Here? How did they get here so fast?
02_04_Ruprecht_V_Hussites=They must have gotten over the palisades somewhere.
02_04_Lothar_V_Girl_Help=Lead us, we'll help you!
02_04_Lothar_V_Girl_NoHelp=We don't have time for this. Run away, girl… And we're going, Rupert.

02_04_Lothar_V_Girl_NoHelp2=But…
02_04_LittleGirl_V_Trap=(laughter)
02_04_Ruprecht_V_Girl_Trap=Lord, deliver us from evil!
02_04_Lothar_V_Girl_Trap=It's a trap!
02_04_Lothar_V_Girl_Finished=I don't know what it was, but clearly, they'd had it in for us. Someone must have known you would be here.
02_04_Ruprecht_V_Girl_Finished=There'll be time to think about that yet. Now we have to get out of here.
02_04_Hussite2_V_Church=Aaaaargh!
02_04_Hussite_V_Church=Away! Quick! Sorcery! Witchcraft! Save yourselves!
02_04_Accessibility_Church_Lighting_Cut=A bolt of lightning has struck the church roof. Hussites are running out of the church, one of them is on fire.
02_04_Lothar_V_Church_Lighting=What happened, father?
02_04_JoachimWeinhard_V_Church_Lighting=God intervened.
02_04_JoachimWeinhard_V_Church_Lighting2=Those godless people wanted to pillage the Lord's church. So, they got what they deserved.
02_04_Lothar_V_Church_Lighting2=God sent lightning?
02_04_JoachimWeinhard_V_Church_Lighting3=And killed their hetman. Yes.
02_04_JoachimWeinhard_V_Church_Lighting4=I'm Joachim Weinhard, honored sirs.

02_04_Lothar_V_NewCityGate=It's Lothar, a knight of St. John, and with him Prior Rupert, the Duke of Lubin and Haynau, and also a local priest from the Church of the Assumption of Virgin Mary!
02_05_Lothar_V_FinalCut_Happened=This should not have happened.
02_05_Ruprecht_V_FinalCut_Happened=Those whom God loves are visited by his cross.
02_05_Lothar_V_FinalCut_Amen=Amen. It is finished.

02_05_Ruprecht_V_FinalCut_Brothers2=They were trying to defend themselves against the heretics' attack and fought until their last breath, but…
02_05_Ruprecht_V_FinalCut_Brothers3=No one survived.
02_05_Lothar_V_FinalCut_Brothers=I should have been there.
02_05_Ruprecht_V_FinalCut_Brothers4=To die as well? Without you, I wouldn't have been here either. The heretics would surely be glad of that. It would have weakened the Order.

02_05_Lothar_V_FinalCut_Sister=I have to go get my sister at Reichenstein. I ask for your permission and several men.
02_05_Ruprecht_V_FinalCut_Sister=This is not the most convenient time. We have to regroup and lead a counterattack. The bishop is calling all noblemen to Wrocław.
02_05_Lothar_V_FinalCut_Sister2=You owe it to me, prior.
02_05_Ruprecht_V_FinalCut_Sister2=You're right. I owe you my life.
02_05_Ruprecht_V_FinalCut_Sister3=Well then, go get your sister.
02_05_Ruprecht_V_FinalCut_Sister4=But I can't send anyone with you. Many brothers fell and I will need every man. You must understand…
02_05_Lothar_V_FinalCut_Sister3=I'll go alone.
02_05_Ruprecht_V_FinalCut_Sister5=Lothar…
02_05_Ruprecht_V_FinalCut_Sister6=As soon as you get her safely into some monastery, return to Little Oels. I need you to stand by my side in future wars.
02_05_Ruprecht_V_FinalCut_Departure=It's time to say goodbye. Be careful, Lothar.
02_05_Lothar_V_FinalCut_Departure=God be with you, brothers. We will meet again soon.
02_05_Ruprecht_V_FinalCut_Departure2=With you as well. Goodbye.

05_03_Hynek_V_SecondElevatorExamine2=This one might be able to take me farther.

05_03_Hynek_V_SecondElevatorNotWorking2=No… I'm pulling the chain but nothing is happening…

05_03_AccessibilityLevelDescriptionWater2=The spacious room sealed off with stone walls has three staircases. They all lead downwards, into the area where there used to be water all over. Now it's just flowing within a tiny duct. A narrow wooden bridge leads across it.
05_03_AccessibilityLevelDescriptionFacilities=The room does not look cozy in the slightest, but it's probably the old utility area for miners. Besides scattered chairs, there are several tables littered with dirty dishes, racks with food and a small stove.
05_03_Hynek_V_DownToPrison=The corridor descends sharply here.
05_03_Hynek_V_ShelfExamine=Pots, dishes… Nothing interesting.

05_03_Hynek_V_Water=This can be a serious problem.
05_03_Hynek_V_Water2=There must be a lot of water. Maybe it's a kind of drainage tank.
05_03_Hynek_V_Water3=What now?
05_03_Hynek_V_PumpExamine=I've seen something like this before. I'd say it helps pump water to the surface.
05_03_Hynek_V_WrongWayWater=I can't pass through here. It's deep, I would drown.

05_04_Hynek_V_Marie_Intentions_True=They captured me in a cave behind Petersdorf, I managed to run away and… I don't know how, but I found myself in front of this mine.
05_04_Marie_V_Marie_Intentions_True=You're lucky, then. My husband tried to escape too. He wanted to rescue me. I haven't heard from him since then.
05_04_Marie_V_Marie_Petr=Do you know anything about him? His name is Peter.
05_04_Hynek_V_Marie_Petr=…
05_04_Hynek_V_Marie_Petr_No=I don't.
05_04_Marie_V_Marie_Petr_No=Hmm… That's too bad… What were you asking?
05_04_Hynek_V_Marie_Petr_YesTrue=Yes. I found him in one of the dead-end mining corridors. Unfortunately, he didn't make it.
05_04_Marie_V_Marie_Petr_YesTrue=What? … Oh God…
05_04_Marie_V_Marie_Petr_YesTrue2=I have nothing left to live for.
05_04_Hynek_V_Marie_Petr_YesLie=Yes. He's alright. He sent me here and he's waiting for you outside.
05_04_Marie_V_Marie_Petr_YesLie=Really? That's amazing! I have to go to him!
05_04_Marie_V_Marie_Petr_YesLie2=How can I help you?
05_04_Hynek_V_Marie_WhatHappened=What happened to you? Why are you locked in here?
05_04_Marie_V_Marie_WhatHappened=That depends.
05_04_Marie_V_Marie_WhatHappened2=Some of us were kidnapped by the knights from Rabesberg, some were bewitched by a priest from Petersdorf and Janesdorf and some are criminals, brought here from jails.
05_04_Marie_V_Marie_WhatHappened3=They enticed me and my husband with an offer to come here for well-paid work.
05_04_Marie_V_Marie_WhatHappened4=You will work really hard for two weeks and you'll earn enough for a whole year, they said.
05_04_Marie_V_Marie_WhatHappened5=We were foolish. We shouldn't have believed them.
05_04_Hynek_V_Marie_HowLong=How long have you been here?
05_04_Marie_V_Marie_HowLong=Some have been here for as long as two months, but they are an exception.

05_04_Marie_V_Marie_Conclusion_Mystery2=Who knows what they want to do with it…

05_04_Marie_V_Marie_Finished=I have nothing more to say to you.
05_04_Hynek_V_DoorFall=Damn it… And it can only be opened from inside.

05_05_Koschei_V_Shout3=You want to kill me? And how? With that pathetic weapon? … Hahaha.
05_05_Koschei_V_Shout4=Come on then, thrust the blade into my chest! If you think you'll pierce my heart, think again!

05_05_Koschei_V_Shout6=Soon you will join my rattling servants. You'll see that eternal life is worth every sacrifice!
05_05_Koschei_V_ShoutOpen=It's pointless! Leave that chest be!
05_05_Koschei_V_ShoutFinal=What do you think this will achieve? You can't pierce it or hurt it in any other way.
05_05_Koschei_V_Killed=Nooo… You won't get away with this so easily!
05_05_KoscheiHeart=Koschei's heart

05_05_MineCollapseCountdownGameover=You remained trapped in the mine
05_05_Hynek_V_MineCollapse=Son of a bitch. What a disaster. It's going to come crashing down on my head.
05_05_Hynek_V_MineCollapse2=I have to get out of here fast!
05_05_Koschei_V_Welcome=So, you really have come. She said that you would but I didn't believe her.
05_05_Hynek_V_Welcome=…
05_05_Hynek_V_Welcome_Who=Who are you?
05_05_Koschei_V_Who=My name is not important and it has long been forgotten. They simply call me Koschei.
05_05_Koschei_V_ThousandYears=I was born almost a thousand years before you.
05_05_Hynek_V_ThousandYears=What? A thousand years before me? What kind of nonsense is that?
05_05_Koschei_V_Story=My father was a famous sorcerer in the far Arabia.
05_05_Koschei_V_Story2=He initiated me into the secrets of his arts but the student soon overshadowed the master.

05_05_Koschei_V_Story4=Devil himself took note of me at the end of my life and offered me immortality, in exchange for my soul and for my eternal service.
05_05_Koschei_V_Story5=And so I serve. My dark master has locked away my life force and made me impervious to injury.
05_05_Koschei_V_Story6=No one can harm me! No one will break my power! Not even you!
05_05_Hynek_V_Welcome_Die=You're going to die now, you pile of bones!

05_05_Hynek_V_Welcome_What=What are your slaves looking for?
05_05_Koschei_V_WhatLord=What my master needs. What he ordered me to look for.
05_05_Hynek_V_WhatLord=Your master? Who is that?
05_05_Koschei_V_WhatLord2=He has many names… The Devil… Lucifer… Satan, Beelzebub, The Prince of Hell…
05_05_Hynek_V_WhatHeavenStone=And what does he need? What did he order you to look for?
05_05_Koschei_V_WhatHeavenStone=My master knows things others do not. He also knows that somewhere beneath the Golden Mountains, there is a powerful artifact which God sent down upon the people from heaven in his holy wrath.
05_05_Hynek_V_WhatSpeak=What does he want it for? Speak!
05_05_Koschei_V_WhatSpeak=That's his business. He does not confide in me and I do not ask.
05_05_Hynek_V_Welcome_Warn=Who told you about me?
05_05_Koschei_V_Welcome_Warn=That doesn't matter. Now you are here and you will be staying here.
05_05_Hynek_V_WarnQuestions=…
05_05_Hynek_V_WarnQuestionsShe=It was her, wasn't it? The woman I glimpsed at Rabesberg?!
05_05_Koschei_V_WarnQuestionsShe=Haha! You mean Lilith? You're off the mark. You don't understand anything.
05_05_Hynek_V_WarnQuestionsSpeak=Speak! Or I will make you!
05_05_Koschei_V_Welcome_Last=Well then, recite your last prayer, Hussite. I don't know what your plan was, but you won't be able to threaten us.
05_06_Lothar_V_Stop=Stop, Hussite! Not one step closer!
05_06_Lothar_V_Stop2=I knew that you were behind it! After all, who else?
05_06_Lothar_V_Sister=Well, speak! Where is my sister!
05_06_Hynek_V_Sister=…
05_06_Lothar_V_SisterSpeak=Speak, do you hear!
05_06_Lothar_V_EndOfPatience=My patience has run out. Prepare to die!
05_06_Hynek_V_SisterWho=What? What sister? I've never met you before.
05_06_Lothar_V_SisterWho=Don't pull any tricks! I know you dragged her here!
05_06_Hynek_V_SisterCollapse=I don't know what you're talking about but we have to get out of here, fast! This mine will collapse at any moment!
05_06_Lothar_V_SisterCollapse=You're not moving an inch until you tell me where she is!
05_06_Hynek_V_Fight=Draw your sword, crusader. You'll die now!
05_06_Hynek_V_Collapse=…
05_06_Hynek_V_CollapseDontKnow=Look, I don't know your sister…
05_06_Lothar_V_CollapseDontKnow=Don't lie! You kidnapped her from Reichenstein. The tracks lead here.
05_06_Hynek_V_CollapseDontKnow2=What tracks? Why do you think she's here?
05_06_Hynek_V_CollapseStop=Stop giving me orders. You crusaders think you can do whatever you want, don't you?
05_06_Lothar_V_CollapseStop=What do you mean by that?
05_06_Hynek_V_CollapseStop2=You've tyrannized our people for long enough! We've had it with you, do you hear me? All those drunk Suffragans, corrupt shavelings, arrogant knights and multiplying popes!
05_06_Lothar_V_CollapseStop2=You'll burn at the stake for such heresy, Hussite! Perhaps your mind is foggy. Was there a pope at Reichenstein, or a Suffragan? Is my sister a knight?
05_06_Hynek_V_CollapseCoincidence=I'm here completely by accident.
05_06_Lothar_V_CollapseCoincidence=Right! I know everything, do you hear me?! I was at Reichenstein and the tracks led me all the way here.
05_06_Lothar_V_Reichenstein=You seized the castle through wicked trickery and took everyone away.
05_06_Lothar_V_Reichenstein2=The cook heard the woman who was giving you orders! She spoke of unfinished work in the Red Mine.
05_06_Hynek_V_Part2=…
05_06_Hynek_V_Part2Woman=A woman, you say? What did she look like?
05_06_Lothar_V_Part2Woman=I'm asking the questions here, heretic!
05_06_Hynek_V_Part2NothingToDo=I didn't have anything to do with that and neither did any of my brothers! The field armies were headed in a completely different direction!
05_06_Hynek_V_Part2NothingToDo2=Didn't the bishop's spies tell you this?
05_06_Lothar_V_Part2Liar=You're lying!
05_06_Hynek_V_Part2Liar=I'm not lying! I swear! By the cross of our Lord!
05_06_Lothar_V_Part2Liar2=Hah! A heretic's oath means nothing.
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Woman=As you wish. But I'll tell you one thing. I have a feeling that I've come across this woman.
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Woman2=Don't grimace. No, she isn't one of the Hussites.
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Castle=Her lackeys captured me and tossed me into the oubliette. I escaped from certain death at the last moment.
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Castle2=It was at some castle not far from Monsterberg.
05_06_Lothar_V_Part3Castle=What kind of fairy stories are you feeding me? At what castle?
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Czirn=Listen for a moment. That castle… belonged to some brothers von Czirn.
05_06_Lothar_V_Part3Czirn=Czirn? …
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Magic=They must be practicing black magic. A priest was with them…
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Magic2=He was opening a magical portal for them to travel through. I myself passed through one such portal, from a cave by Petersdorf to that very castle.
05_06_Lothar_V_Part3Czirn2=Czirn? … Czirn! Oh, I know. They recently acquired a small castle at Gromnik. I suspect it's called Rabesberg…
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Czirn2=That's it!
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Czirn3=That woman arrived to that castle. It seemed that the Czirns were following her orders. She was probably buying slaves from them, which they then used as miners here in the mine.
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Czirn4=She ordered them to kill me but I managed to escape.
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Unicorn=When I was lost in the forest not far from the castle, suddenly a unicorn appeared…
05_06_Lothar_V_Part3Unicorn=God… you're not a heretic. You are lunatic!
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Unicorn2=Listen! I know it sounds crazy, but if you'd have seen what I've seen, you'd believe me!
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Unicorn3=A unicorn brought me here to the mine. It seems that for some reason, it wanted me to go inside.
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Skeletons=I came across the undead deep inside the mine shafts. Real walking and thinking skeletons, armed with swords and axes.
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Skeletons2=They were controlled by Koschei. An ancient sorcerer who apparently served the Devil himself!
05_06_Lothar_V_Part3Crazy=You're insane. I've had enough of you. I won't listen to any more of this nonsense.
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Anna=He screamed that he would kill me even though I had been brought here by some Anna who had sorcerer's blood…
05_06_Lothar_V_Part3Anna=What? What did you just say?
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Anna2=I don't understand it myself… I don't know any Anna.
05_06_Lothar_V_Part3Anna2=But I do.
05_06_Lothar_V_Part3Anna3=Anna is my sister.
05_06_Lothar_V_Part3Silence=…
05_06_Hynek_V_Part3Escape=Shit. We have to get out of here. The mine will collapse on both of us soon!
05_06_Lothar_V_Part3Escape=Alright… But that doesn't mean that I'm letting you go, heretic. You go first.
05_07_AccessibilityCut=Hynek and Lothar ran out of the mine at the last second. The entire mine collapsed and the entrance was caved in with rocks.
05_07_Hynek_V_Final=That was close.
05_07_Lothar_V_Final=Well, Hussite… Tell me everything else you know!
05_07_Hynek_V_FinalName=After you stop calling me Hussite. My name is Hynek.
05_07_Lothar_V_FinalName=Speak.
05_07_Hynek_V_FinalDontKnowMore=I truly don't know anything else. Maybe just…
05_07_Hynek_V_FinalMunsterberg=That woman mentioned Monsterberg. That she had to go back there, to John.
05_07_Lothar_V_FinalMunsterberg=The Duke? What could he have to do with all this?
05_07_Lothar_V_FinalReturn=I have to find out who that woman is. I can't do anything else here anyway.
05_07_Lothar_V_FinalReturn2=There's no choice left for me but to return to the commandery and ask the brothers for help. Then I'll set off for Monsterberg.
05_07_Hynek_V_FinalReturn=I wish you a safe journey. I will go after my own business.
05_07_Lothar_V_Farewell=Alright then.
05_07_Lothar_V_Farewell2=Go back to your heretic army, Hynek.
05_07_Lothar_V_Farewell3=But remember my name. I am Lothar von Reichenstein.
05_07_Lothar_V_Farewell4=Beg God for us to never meet again. I'd have to kill you then.

07_01_Slama_V_Yesterday_Cave7=We kept on going till daybreak. Then Puchala decided to move on without you. We gave Edelstein a wide berth out of caution and burnt down Ziegenhals with Otto.
07_01_Slama_V_Yesterday_Cave8=We couldn't search any longer. Blazek was waiting by Prudnik.
07_01_Hynek_V_Slama_Yesterday_Cave3=You did the right thing. I was long gone by then anyway.
07_01_Hynek_V_Slama_Yesterday_Believe=I hope at least you believe what happened to me?

07_01_Slama_V_Yesterday_Believe3=Do you know what the mountain where you got stuck in the cave is called?
07_01_Slama_V_Yesterday_Believe4=Devil's Mountain! And right next to it is Devil's Rock. Bleurgh. Devil's land, I say.
07_01_Slama_V_Yesterday_Believe5=My dear mother, may she rest in peace, did see the devil once with her own eyes! And I'm telling you, when…
07_01_Hynek_V_Slama_Yesterday_Believe2=Yeah, yeah… Please spare me. I've already heard this story.
07_01_Slama_V_Yesterday_Believe6=Alright, as you wish.
07_01_Hynek_V_Slama_Yesterday_End=I have to go.
07_01_Hynek_V_OrangePotionSelf=Ugh… that wasn't the best idea. I hope it'll be better now.
07_01_Hynek_V_Divis_Intro=Praised be Jesus Christ.
07_01_Divis_V_Intro=Now and forever!
07_01_Hynek_V_Divis_Silence=…
07_01_Hynek_V_Divis_Confession=I need to confess, father.
07_01_Hynek_V_Divis_Confession2=It's been a week since I last confessed…
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Confession=… I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
07_01_Hynek_V_Divis_Confession3=Amen.
07_01_Hynek_V_Divis_Nysa=Tell me about Nysa, father. Was it a big battle?
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Nysa=You missed a lot, Hynek. God granted us a glorious victory.
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Nysa2=While it was still dark, the Knights Hospitaller tried to trick us and attacked our encampment.
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Nysa3=But we knew about their plan in advance and lured them into a trap. Not many of them made it out.
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Nysa4=We almost captured even the Hospitaller prior himself.
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Nysa5=The gates of Nysa opened for us as easily as the gates of heaven would one day.
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Nysa6=The Silesian nobility escaped like cowards behind the stone ramparts of the New Town.
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Nysa7=And those who tried to defend the Old Town are now wailing in Purgatory, their homes in ashes.
07_01_Hynek_V_Divis_Believe=Father, you do believe what happened to me while I was gone?
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Believe=For your own good, Hynek, I hope that story is not just another one of your drunken eccentricities. That would be over the top already.
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Believe2=But I believe you. The Scripture tells us…
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Believe3=Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Believe4=The last struggle may be approaching and we must be prepared.
07_01_Hynek_V_Divis_Messengers=I heard that we were expecting messengers with ransom today. Has anyone arrived yet?
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Messengers=Our victory at Nysa hasn't seemed to teach the Silesian nobility a sufficient lesson.
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Messengers2=The messengers from Duke Ludwig arrived in the morning, but they refused to pay a satisfactory sum.
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Messengers3=We are expecting the Monsterberg party at any moment.
07_01_Divis_V_Divis_Messengers4=Let's hope that Duke John doesn't hesitate as much to shake his pouch around a bit in order for us to spare his manor.
07_01_Hynek_V_Divis_Messengers2=Hmm… I wonder who's coming to negotiate in his name?
07_01_Hynek_V_Divis_End=I shall be going.
07_01_Hynek_V_Farkle=And what may you be doing here, brother? Killing time?
07_01_Hussite_V_Farkle=Hynek! You're coming as if you were being summoned!
07_01_Hussite_V_Farkle2=You surely feel like playing some Farkle with me? Gonna bet a groschen?
07_01_Hynek_V_Farkle_Silence=…
07_01_Hynek_V_Farkle_Yes=Well, why not. A bit of distraction never hurt anyone.
07_01_Hynek_V_Farkle_No=Don't you have anything better to do? Watch out, lest I find something for you!
07_01_Hussite_V_Farkle_No=Don't you get angry! My work is done, and even God himself rested on the seventh day.
07_01_Hynek_V_Farkle_No2=But not while playing Farkle, you heathen! If Prokop or one of the priests sees us, we're in for trouble!
07_01_Hussite_V_Farkle_No2=Well, nothing happened, did it?!
07_01_Hynek_V_Farkle_NoCoin=I'd love to, but I have no Groschen.
07_01_Hussite_V_Farkle_NoCoin=Pity. Come when you have something to play for.
07_01_Hussite_V_Farkle_NoSilence=You're as fun as horseshit.
07_01_Hussite_V_Farkle_Yes=Wonderful. Lay down your arse. You roll first.
07_01_HussiteFarkle_V_FarkleGreatRound1=The Lord smiles upon me.
07_01_HussiteFarkle_V_FarkleGreatRound2=Nice…
07_01_HussiteFarkle_V_FarkleGreatRound3=Huh! You're done for.
07_01_HussiteFarkle_V_FarkleGreatRound4=That's how I like it!
07_01_HussiteFarkle_V_FarkleGreatRound5=There goes the clinking, there goes the clinking.
07_01_HussiteFarkle_V_FarkleGreatRound6=Thought you'd rob me, right? But I'm gonna be no easy fight!
07_01_HussiteFarkle_V_FarkleBusted1=Not possible!
07_01_HussiteFarkle_V_FarkleBusted2=Worth shit.
07_01_HussiteFarkle_V_FarkleBusted3=Fucking nothing.
07_01_HussiteFarkle_V_FarkleBusted4=They're not falling right for me today.
07_01_HussiteFarkle_V_FarkleBusted5=Oh come on! Fuck.
07_01_HussiteFarkle_V_FarkleBusted6=Fuck!
07_01_Herald_V_Announces=(horns blowing)
07_01_Herald_V_Announces2=The messengers from Monsterberg are arriving!
07_01_Herald_V_Announces3=The Noble Lady Lilith of Devil's Mountain, with the commissioning of Duke John and the town's council!
07_01_GuardAmbrose_V_AccessDenied=Sorry, Hynek, but you can't pass. Prokop is admitting the messengers now.
07_01_GuardAmbrose_V_AccessDenied2=Hey! Did you hear me? Get away from here!
07_01_GuardAmbrose_V_AccessDenied3=Are you drunk again?! Entrance is prohibited right now.
07_01_GuardAmbrose_V_AccessDenied4=I'm sorry, Hynek, but the meeting is by invitation only.
07_01_GuardAmbrose_V_Wine=Hynek, you're hanging around here with nothing to do. Could I ask you for a favor?
07_01_Hynek_V_Wine_Silence=…
07_01_Hynek_V_Wine_No=It just looks that way. I don't have time, sorry.
07_01_GuardAmbrose_V_No=Oh, never mind then.
07_01_Hynek_V_Wine_Yes=What can I help you with?
07_01_GuardAmbrose_V_Wine_Yes=You know what a martinet brother Blazek is. I don't dare move an inch from my post.
07_01_GuardAmbrose_V_Wine_Yes2=But I got really thirsty all of a sudden. Could you fetch a little bit of wine for my waterskin?
07_01_Hynek_V_Wine_Yes2=That shouldn't be a problem.
07_01_Canteen=Empty waterskin
07_01_Canteen4=Empty waterskin
07_01_CanteenWithWine=Waterskin with wine
07_01_CanteenWithWine4=Waterskin with wine
07_01_CanteenWithOrangePotion=Waterskin with improved wine
07_01_CanteenWithOrangePotion4=Waterskin with improved wine
07_01_Hynek_V_Canteen=Cheers.
07_01_GuardAmbrose_V_Canteen=God bless.
07_01_GuardAmbrose_V_Toilet=Hynek! I need to go to the latrine urgently. Could you watch things for me for a while?
07_01_Hynek_V_Toilet=I'm happy to help, friend.
07_01_Hynek_V_PribikFill=Ambrose is sending me for a little bit of wine.
07_01_Pribik_V_Fill=Hm. Hm…
07_01_Pribik_V_AddAffectable=Hey! What are you doing?! Get some wine but do not touch the barrel!
07_01_Hynek_V_SlamaHelp=Could you help me? I need to keep Robby busy for a moment.
07_01_Slama_V_Help=What kind of mischief are you trying to stir up again? (laughter)
07_01_Slama_V_HelpSimple=Again, already?
07_01_Slama_V_Help2=Fine. You know I won't stand in the way of some fun.
07_01_Slama_V_Help3=You probably won't tell me why you need that, will you?
07_01_Hynek_V_SlamaHelp2=You guessed right.
07_01_Slama_V_PribikTalk=Hey… You… What's this thingie here?
07_01_Pribik_V_PribikTalk=What thingie?
07_01_Slama_V_PribikTalk2=This thingie…
07_01_Pribik_V_PribikTalk2=You mean this right here?
07_01_Slama_V_PribikTalk3=No, not that. This…
07_01_Pribik_V_PribikTalk3=I don't know what you want from me, Straw. You're just trying to piss me off again, aren't you?
07_01_Slama_V_PribikTalk4=Not at all. I feel like I'm in the mood for something tasty.
07_01_Pribik_V_PribikTalk4=You know what, leave me alone. Go slack away somewhere else.
07_01_Slama_V_PribikTalk5=Alright… Alright… Don't be getting hot under the collar… I'm going.
07_01_Hynek_V_SlamaCoin=I need a little loan. Would you lend me a ducat, please?
07_01_Slama_V_SlamaCoin=Oh here we go… Alright, fine, just because it's you.
07_01_Slama_V_SlamaCoin2=This is the last one I have here. I hope it doesn't end up like last time.
07_01_Hynek_V_SlamaCoin2=Don't worry. I'll return it as soon as I can.
07_01_Slama_V_SlamaCoin3=Meaning never.
07_01_Hynek_V_AfterAmbroseWrongWay=I can't go that way. I'd give myself away.
07_01_TentPeephole7=through the hole in the tent
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_MonsterbergRansom=Noble lady, please tell the Duke that we are honored to receive his gifts.
07_01_Lilith_V_MonsterbergRansom=Can my lord consider the amount of gold I've handed over a sufficient guarantee of his city staying safe from your men?
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_MonsterbergRansom2=Upon my honor. No one will come close to the city.
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_MonsterbergRansom3=But my eyes may not linger everywhere. I'm sure you understand.
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_MonsterbergRansom4=Now and then, say a troop might stray into neighboring villages.
07_01_DobesPuchala_V_MonsterbergRansom=It happens. Once, for instance, I strayed from Poland like that and now I prefer to stay close to the others.
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_MonsterbergRansom5=Hush, Dobes!
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_MonsterbergRansom6=Please excuse my friend's foul mouth.
07_01_BlazekKralup_V_MonsterbergRansom=Wealth will not protect him from God's wrath!
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_MonsterbergRansom7=Quiet, Blazek!
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_MonsterbergRansom8=What my brethren are trying to say is that the open arms of true faith would provide the greatest safety guarantee for John of Monsterberg.
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_MonsterbergRansom9=Tell him to accept the chalice and become one of us.
07_01_Lilith_V_MonsterbergRansom2=I cannot help you there, preacher. The faith of my Lord is too firm.
07_01_Lilith_V_MonsterbergRansom3=I often witness its firmness myself, when I support him during his prayers.
07_01_Lilith_V_MonsterbergRansom4=It was a pleasure, gentlemen.
07_01_Hynek_V_MonsterbergRansom=Now I recognize the voice – ominous and arrogant – it's her.
07_01_Hynek_V_MonsterbergRansom2=The woman who ordered the bandits at Rabesberg to kidnap villagers and to execute me!
07_01_Hynek_V_MonsterbergRansom3=I have to find out more about her!
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop=Brother Prokop, I have to talk to you!
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop=How did you get in here? Where are the guards?
07_01_BlazekKralup_V_Prokop=Is this that liar and drunkard?
07_01_DobesPuchala_V_Prokop=He puked on my surcoat, that pig!
07_01_OtaLosy_V_Prokop=Catch the rascal, he'll get his twenty lashes as was agreed.
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop2=That woman leading the Monsterberg messengers…
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop2=Noble Lady Lilith of Devil's Mountain.
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop3=She's the one who paid the robber knights at Rabesberg. She ordered them to kidnap villagers and was going to have me slain.
07_01_BlazekKralup_V_Prokop2=Is he making something up again? Let us smell his breath, that boozer!
07_01_OtaLosy_V_Prokop2=Catch that rascal and he'll get twenty lashes as was agreed.
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop4=I'm not making anything up! I couldn't see what she looked like at that time but I recognized her perfectly by her voice.
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop5=At first, I wasn't sure, she was playing it nice, but then when she cut you down to size about the firm faith of her lord…
07_01_DobesPuchala_V_Prokop2=I don't understand what she meant about the firm faith which she supposedly witnesses?
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop6=… It was immediately clear to me that it's her. When someone sentences you to death without even knowing you, you remember them!
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop3=Even if everything you told us was true and Lilith of the Devil's Mountain was truly the woman you think she is, what happens at Monsterberg manor is not our business!
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop7=If God's laws are violated, it's the business of us all, brother.
07_01_BlazekKralup_V_Prokop03=He's right about that, Prokop!
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop4=And what do you think we should do, Hynek?
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop5=I received payment for peace and for Hussite armies to avoid Monsterberg from that woman.
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop6=I cannot and will not break an honorable oath that I've made.
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop8=I didn't swear anything! Let me watch their camp, and once they start heading back to town tomorrow, I will mix in with their crew or hide somewhere.
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop9=No one will notice me and I will figure it all out.
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop7=Under no circumstances! You get a taste of booze and they capture you as a spy.
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop10=So what? Will they ask for their ransom back?
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop11=The undead and the black magic, the power of which I witnessed, could represent a threat to Silesia, as well as to the field armies and the entire kingdom.
07_01_DobesPuchala_V_Prokop3=We'll assault Monsterberg and slaughter them!
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop8=Hush, you hothead!
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop12=We're not risking anything. She already gave the order to have me killed once. If she catches me, she gets another opportunity to do that.
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop13=I will claim that I was acting on my own.
07_01_BlazekKralup_V_Prokop3=What an idea! Either we find out what evil against God's laws the people of Monsterberg are committing and punish them by right, or we lose a drunkard.
07_01_BlazekKralup_V_Prokop4=From where I'm standing, that plan only has advantages.
07_01_BlazekKralup_V_Prokop5=Besides, what if he's telling the truth after all and the dead are returning from their graves?
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop9=You're neither a scout nor a spy, Hynek.
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop14=That's where you're wrong, brother. I took part in a similar mission once. Still with Zizka.
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop15=True, it was among the Adamites, so there was no need to disguise myself. And the good Lord endowed me so well that no one even looked in my face…
07_01_DobesPuchala_V_Prokop4=Braggart!
07_01_BlazekKralup_V_Prokop6=He's making things up again!
07_01_DobesPuchala_V_Prokop5=How do you know that, Blazek?
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop10=Did he not spy at the Adamites?
07_01_BlazekKralup_V_Prokop7=Hmm… He's not lying about the Adamites. He was there and he truly proved himself useful.
07_01_BlazekKralup_V_Prokop8=Let him go to the Monsterberg folk, brother. May he find out whether any blasphemy is indeed taking place there and whether they pose any danger to us.
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop11=Ermm…
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop12=Alright, Hynek. Go and act according to your best judgment.
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop13=But think of God Almighty while you're there, and know that if you are discovered, none of the brethren shall come to your aid.
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop16=Do not worry, brother, I will not betray your trust.
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop14=May God direct your steps.
07_01_DobesPuchala_V_Prokop6=Also, find out more about that firm faith of John Monsterberg's.
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop15=Tomorrow, we shall head towards Falkenberg. If you succeed, you will find us there.
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop16=The Falkenberg Duke Bernard didn't send a party to negotiate the ransom.
07_01_ProkopHoly_V_Prokop17=We'll have to talk to him in person, then.
07_01_DobesPuchala_V_Prokop7=And let the cannons do the talking!
07_01_Hynek_V_Prokop17=I'm only asking for one thing. Dedicate a prayer to me, brethren. For my success.
07_01_OtaLosy_V_Prokop3=He should have received his twenty lashes first… As was agreed.
07_01_AccessibilityFinalMarker=Leave the commander's tent
07_02_Cut=The camp of Monsterberg's messengers<br>Just outside Patschkau, Silesia
07_02_Intro_AccessibilityCut=It got dark. Several tents are erected near the river, on a meadow among the trees. They're being lit just by the light of the hearths and the torches of the guards who patrol nearby.
07_02_AccessibilityDescription=It's dark. You are on a meadow by the river, where there are several tents erected among the trees. They're being lit only by the light of the hearths.
07_02_Hynek_V_Intro=I can see their entire camp at a glance, and nothing out of the ordinary seems to be happening.
07_02_Hynek_V_Intro2=There's nothing for it, I have to get closer. They don't have very many guards posted and darkness is on my side.
07_02_Hynek_V_Hide=Over there. That wagon. I could hide in there.
07_02_Hynek_V_HideSoon=Not yet. First, I have to find out more about that Lilith.
07_ItsAllHerFault_Infiltrate_GameOver=You've been compromised
07_02_AccessibilityCampNorth=Northern part of the camp
07_02_AccessibilityCampSouth=Southern part of the camp
07_02_AccessibilityCampEast=Eastern part of the camp
07_02_AccessibilityCampWest=Western part of the camp
07_02_LilithLetter=Decree of commission
07_02_LilithLetterText=        We, John of Piast blood, in God's grace Duke of Monsterberg,<br>        thus announce in this decree to all persons who may set their eyes upon it or hear it read aloud, that the noble Lady Lilith of Devil's Mountain is the only and true messenger of mine, authorized in the dealings with the Hussite Army and its leaders. As by me she is chosen, known for her wisdom, and far beyond anyone's vision by her nobility.<br>        Those who act against her shalt receive capital punishment, for she is the direct agent of my will.<br>        Bestowed in Monsterberg, year of the Lord 1428 on the 21st day of March, written by the notary's hand and confirmed by the presence of many witnesses of burgher status.<br><br><br><br>
07_02_Hynek_V_LilithLetter=Hmm… What did she do to bewitch him like that?
07_02_Hynek_V_Outro=The chest once storing the treasure for God's warriors.
07_02_Hynek_V_Outro2=I'll be perfectly fine here.
07_03_Cut=The next morning<br>Patschkau Gate, Monsterberg, Silesia
07_03_AccessibilityCut1=A cavalcade of wagons and riders is entering the town which is surrounded by a broad moat and stone battlements.
07_03_AccessibilityCut2=Hynek peeks inconspicuously from inside one of the wagons.
07_03_AccessibilityCut3=The group has split up, and the wagon with Hynek is suddenly stopping by the parsonage near the town square. Hynek carefully comes out.
07_03_AccessibilityDescriptionRectory=You are at the courtyard of the local Franciscan church's parsonage. Hens blunder around everyone's feet, there are several washing lines with hanging clothes nearby, and there is also a latrine.
07_03_AccessibilityDescriptionCity=You are in the bustling streets of Monsterberg. Everyone is in a hurry to get somewhere, whether on foot or on horseback.
07_03_AccessibilityDescriptionCastle=You are at the Monsterberg castle. You can see several buildings, including a stable and a blacksmith. Guards are training with swords on a raised wooden stage. A second gate leads into the palace, separated by another rampart.
07_03_AccessibilityMonkGroup=Group of monks
07_03_AccessibilityMonkGroupEnter=You've melted into the group of monks.
07_03_AccessibilityMonkGroupExit=You've left the group of monks.
07_03_Hynek_V_Intro=Erm. And now what.
07_03_Hynek_V_Intro2=I was hoping they'd drive me all the way to the castle's courtyard, not that they'd stop by the first whorehouse!
07_03_Hynek_V_Intro3=I'll have to get inside the castle on foot. But I can't quite stroll through town with a chalice on my chest.
07_03_Franciscan_V_Prayer1=Pater noster, qui es in coelis…
07_03_Franciscan_V_Prayer2=Sanctificetur nomen tuum…
07_03_Franciscan_V_Prayer3=Adveniat regnum tuum…
07_03_Franciscan_V_Prayer4=Fiat voluntas tua…
07_03_Franciscan_V_Prayer5=Sicut in coelo, et in terra.
07_03_Franciscan_V_Prayer6=Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie…
07_03_Franciscan_V_Prayer7=Et dimitte nobis debita nostra…
07_03_Franciscan_V_Prayer8=Sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris…
07_03_Franciscan_V_Prayer9=Et ne nos inducas in tentationem…
07_03_Franciscan_V_Prayer10=Sed libera nos a malo.
07_03_Burgher_V_Hussite=Guards! Guards! There's a Hussite here!
07_03_Burgher_V_Hussite2=Guards! Alert! Hussite!
07_03_Burgheress_V_Hussite=Folks! Where is everyone? Hussites are here! Alert!
07_03_Burgheress_V_Hussite2=Hussite! Hussite! Help!
07_03_Hynek_V_RobeTaken=I might be more inconspicuous this way. But I'd rather stay away from the guards anyway.
07_03_Hynek_V_RobeTaken2=And now, no more sneaking around. Just doing my thing…
07_03_Guard_V_Monks=Hey Tobias, don't you have a hunch that the town is full of monks?
07_03_GuardTobias_V_Monks=It's those Franciscans. They fled from the Hussites in the south.
07_03_GuardTobias_V_Monks2=There's more of them than rats here. I hope the ratcatcher isn't on their heels… (laughter)
07_03_Guard_V_Monks2=I don't know about that. Helping thy neighbour… That's fine… But couldn't we be helping them somewhere else?
07_03_GuardTobias_V_Monks3=Hardly. The Hussite armies are all around us, burning whatever crosses their path.
07_03_GuardTobias_V_Monks4=I got the wind that the Duke paid their ransom. Not just mendicant monks but villagers too are gathering behind our walls. So that they wouldn't have to trudge all the way to Wrocław.
07_03_Guard_V_Monks3=Well yeah, but what are we supposed to do with them here? So many hungry mouths, it's going to cause nothing but problems, you'll see! They don't have a clue about life in a town.
07_03_Guard_V_Monks4=In the end, we'll get extra shifts just to keep them in check.
07_03_GuardTobias_V_Monks5=Oh well, that's that.
07_03_Guard_V_Suspicion=Hey you! Monk!
07_03_Hynek_V_Suspicion_Silence=…
07_03_Hynek_V_Suspicion_NotBother=Don't you bother me!
07_03_Hynek_V_Suspicion_Want=What are you demanding, fair youth?
07_03_Hynek_V_Suspicion_Lord=Praise the Lord.
07_03_Hynek_V_Suspicion_Yes=Yes?
07_03_Guard_V_Question=I don't know you! Why are you wandering around here all alone like that?
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_Silence=…
07_03_Guard_V_Question_OneMoreTime=I'll ask you once more! Who are you?
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_Others=I'm on my way to join the rest of my brethren. Oh! There they are.
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_Mother=I'm just looking for the abbess…
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_God=I am contemplating God's providence.
07_03_Guard_V_Question_God=God's providence?
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_God2=That he only puts such obstacles in our path that we can overcome.
07_03_Guard_V_Question_God2=…
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_God3=Go in peace, son.
07_03_Guard_V_Question_God3=You as well… God… God… God be with you…
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_Nothing=Nothing.
07_03_Guard_V_Question_Nothing=Nothing?
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_Nothing2=Right, nothing.
07_03_Guard_V_Question_Nothing2=Really, nothing?
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_Nothing3=Yes, really…
07_03_Hynek_V_Run=Sorry. I have to be on my way!
07_03_Guard_V_OK=Alright, then, run along. And next time, don't stare so stupidly.
07_03_Guard_V_Fail=You're suspicious as hell. You're coming with me, we'll see about you!
07_03_Guard2_V_Suspicion=Hey you! Monk!
07_03_Guard2_V_SuspicionShield=Hey you! You with the shield!
07_03_Guard2_V_Question=Who the heck are you? And why the fuck do you have a weapon in your belt?
07_03_Guard2_V_QuestionShield=Who the hell are you? Since when do Franciscans carry shields?
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_Shield=We are establishing a new combatant order.
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_Incense=That's not a weapon. It's just a censer… New model.
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_Robots=That's not the monk you're looking for!
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_LyingThere=It was lying right there. I was rushing over to hand it to you so that no one would trip over it!
07_03_Hynek_V_Question_NothingAgain=I found it right there. I was rushing over to hand it to you!
07_03_Guard2_V_Fail=Don't you take another step! You're coming with me!
07_03_Guard2_V_FailShield=I don't trust you an inch. You're coming with me!
07_03_Hynek_V_AccessibilityHelp=This is a good place for me to leave the group. The other group of monks comes in the castle this way. I have to wait for them.
07_03_AccessibilityLothar=Lothar suddenly stepped out of the apothecary at the town square.
07_03_AccessibilityLothar2=He noticed Hynek and carefully started following him. He's just a couple fathoms behind your back.
07_03_Lothar_V_Peter=Well, thank you once again, Peter. You've helped me a lot!
07_03_Lothar_V_Peter2=I pray you to prosper! Go with God!
07_03_Lothar_V_What=What the…?
07_03_Hynek_V_LotharSaw=And I'm in deep shit. I'm sure he recognized me.
07_03_Lothar_V_LotharSaw=I wonder, what's he up to?
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar=Hey you! Monk!
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar2=Or should I say, Hussite?
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar=Shh. Not so loud.
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar3=What are you doing, snooping around here? Did they send you to spy? You're supposed to carry out some sort of sabotage, aren't you?
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar2=A fat lot. I'm tracking… tracking this woman.
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar4=What are you making up now? I promised to kill you if I ever meet you again.
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar3=You'd be shitting in your own nest, lad. You won't believe it, but…
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar5=You're right. I don't believe you.
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar4=Have you found your sister yet?
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar6=Don't you provoke me! Or do you know anything about her?
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar5=I know the name of the woman who kidnapped her.
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar7=Speak!
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar6=Get me inside the castle and you will find out what you need - and maybe more.
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar8=I could turn you in to the Duke and you'd confess everything in the torture chamber, heretic!
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar7=You could, but that bitch who kidnapped your sister stands right by the Duke's side.
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar8=Yesterday, she arrived at our camp at Patschkau.
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar9=She was negotiating the ransom there, acting in the name of Duke John and the town of Monsterberg!
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar10=Would you risk her wiggling her bottom in front of him and him not hearing you out?
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar9=Why are you trying to get into the castle?
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar11=You didn't believe me when i told you about the undead, the dark magic and the warlocks in front of the Red Mine…
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar11b=Then at least believe the fact that the bitch is seeking my death for no reason. I want to know why.
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar10=I might even start believing these tales of yours…
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar12=Oh… Getting a hunch too?
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar11=I'm traveling from the commandery in Little Oels. Someone slaughtered everyone there.
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar12=And stole an ancient artifact from the crypt under the chapel… A powerful artifact.
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar13=You look as though you'd been hiding the Holy Grail there! (laughter)
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar13=The Holy Spear.
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar14=Go to hell with such cock and bull stories, how would the Knights Hospitaller get their hands on the Spear of Destiny?
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar14=The commandery used to belong to the Templars, it must have been them who'd hidden it there.
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar15=All I found was an empty hiding place and the linen in which it had been wrapped.
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar16=I have a friend here in Monsterberg who specializes in such things.
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar17=He confirmed that my assumption might be right.
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar15=Skeletons, warlocks, the Spear of Destiny and the Noble Lady Lilith of Devil's Mountain.
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar18=What did you say the woman's name was? Lilith? Like that demoness?
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar16=True, that hasn't occurred to me… If only you saw the godless atrocities committed on her orders…
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar19=I have. At home at Reichenstein castle.
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar17=I give you my word that I will help you save your sister from her clutches, if you help me get inside the castle and find out more about this Lilith.
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar18=This cowl was enough for me to walk across the town, but I won't get in the palace with it. I'm as inconspicuous as a fox in a henhouse.
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar20=Fine. What's your plan?
07_03_Hynek_V_HynekLothar19=I'll think of something.
07_03_Lothar_V_HynekLothar24=Don't think for too long. In the meantime, I'll try to arrange an audience with the Duke and then I'll wait for you by the chapel.
07_03_AccessibilityMarkerPalace=Palace entrance
07_03_AccessibilityMarkerDogs=Kennels
07_03_AccessibilityMarkerSecondGate=Second gate
07_03_AccessibilityMarkerBlacksmith=Blacksmith
07_03_Hynek_V_Audience=Well? How did it go?
07_03_Lothar_V_Audience=Don't even remind me. The earliest the Duke can receive me is next week.
07_03_Lothar_V_Audience2=I can't wait that long. My sister might be in danger.
07_03_Hynek_V_Audience2=Time for a backup plan…
07_03_Lothar_V_Audience3=And what's that?
07_03_Hynek_V_Audience3=I don't know yet.
07_03_Lothar_V_Idea=Have you come up with anything yet?
07_03_Hynek_V_Idea=I'm working on it.
07_03_Hynek_V_Rope=Look. I got a rope.
07_03_Lothar_V_Rope=Suicide is a mortal sin in the eyes of the Lord.
07_03_Hynek_V_Rope2=I'm not hanging myself. They will let you in, and I'll climb this rope which you will tie in a window.
07_03_Lothar_V_Rope2=And once we're inside, what then?
07_03_Hynek_V_Rope3=We'll look around a bit, and if worse comes to worst, we'll admit ourselves for the audience with the Duke.
07_03_Lothar_V_Rope3=Have you gone mad? They will execute us both.
07_03_Hynek_V_Rope4=Do you want to save your sister? The merciful Duke will be merciful in deed if we come to him with such urgent matters like the life of a Silesian noblewoman, right?
07_03_Lothar_V_Rope4=I don't know… But hopefully you are right.
07_03_Lothar_V_Rope5=I'm going to go find an empty room.
07_03_Hynek_V_RopeFinished=There! It worked. Get the rope!
07_03_Hynek_V_RopeClimb=Well begun is half done.
07_03_Hynek_V_PalaceWrongWay=I can't just march in there. It's too much of a risk. The guards would stop me immediately.
07_03_Rope_AccessibilityCut=A rope flew out of one of the windows, its end hanging just a little above the ground. Unfortunately, the window is located right above the kennels.
07_04_AccessibilityDescriptionDefault=You are in the corridors of the Monsterberg castle.
07_04_AccessibilityDescriptionA=You are standing in a spacious bedroom with a fireplace and two windows. There is a wooden cross hanging above the bed.
07_04_AccessibilityDescriptionB=You are in the room where you entered the castle using the rope. It's probably the burgrave's, or another officer's study. The main feature of the room is a huge oak desk covered with all kinds of various documents.
07_04_AccessibilityDescriptionC=You are standing in a room where, besides a candle stand, there is just a latrine and a massive wooden staircase. It goes both up and down. There are no windows, and thus the candles are the only source of light.
07_04_AccessibilityDescriptionD=You are in the dining hall. The huge wooden table in the center is obviously the main feature of the room. There are hunting trophies hanging on the walls, the floor is partially covered with a carpet.
07_04_AccessibilityDescriptionX=You are in a narrow corridor, separated from the others by two double-leaf doors. One of them leads into the Duke's chambers, the other back into the castle.
07_04_AccessibilityDescriptionDukeRoom=You are in the richly decorated Duke's chambers. There are several windows, a large bed, a fireplace, wardrobes, and armchairs to sit in. The floors are covered with expensive carpets and scattered clothes. In the southern corner, there is a tiny separate study.
07_04_Lothar_V_Castle=Hoorah, finally.
07_04_Hynek_V_Castle=I had a bit of an issue with some dogs.
07_04_Lothar_V_Castle2=Alright. And now what? The Duke is being guarded by four guys and they're definitely not letting us near him.
07_04_Lothar_V_Castle3=Don't think I'll let you raise your hand against a Christian, Hussite!
07_04_Hynek_V_Castle2=Don't worry. I'll leave my weapon by my waist.
07_04_Hynek_V_Castle3=With me!
07_04_Lothar_V_Door=Wonderful! That's what I call a plan.
07_04_Lothar_V_Door2=And just like that I've turned a traitor…
07_04_Hynek_V_Door=You're fretting like a primipara. Nothing's happened to anyone. We're just gonna talk to the Duke.
07_04_Hynek_V_Door2=No doubt you'll be able to explain it to him somehow.
07_04_Lothar_V_Door3=God be with me.
07_04_AccessibilityCut1=Hynek and Lothar have entered the Duke's chambers. Duke John is just busy giving Lilith his attention from behind on a bed.
07_04_AccessibilityCut2=Only now, the two have noticed the intruders. John gave a start, but Lilith calmly climbed off the bed and faced them entirely naked.
07_04_AccessibilityCut3=Lilith is changing shape, horns, wings and a tail are sprouting on her body.
07_04_AccessibilityCut4=Lilith broke a window and flew outside.
07_04_AccessibilityCut5=The Duke leaves for the entrance, Hynek and Lothar follow him.
07_04_Lothar_V_DukeRoomEnter=This is going to be difficult to explain…
07_04_Lothar_V_DukeRoomEnter2=Ahem… Ahem…
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_DukeRoomEnter=Fucking hell! What are you doing in here?
07_04_Lilith_V_DukeRoomEnter=Don't worry, my Duke.
07_04_Lilith_V_DukeRoomEnter2=Hynek and Lothar! What a surprise. It's not often that the mouse crawls in the cat's lair willingly.
07_04_Lilith_V_DukeRoomEnter3=(laughter)
07_04_Lilith_V_DukeRoomEnter4=You might have come at an inconvenient time, but one must seize the opportunity!
07_04_Lothar_V_DukeRoomEnter3=That's the Lilith woman?
07_04_Hynek_V_DukeRoomEnter=The tail is news to me too.
07_04_Lothar_V_DukeRoomEnter4=Where is my sister, demon! Speak!
07_04_Lilith_V_DukeRoomEnter5=Oh… Poor Anna…
07_04_Lilith_V_DukeRoomEnter6=She is safe, under my protection. Don't worry, Lothar.
07_04_Lilith_V_DukeRoomEnter7=Once she's served her purpose, her soul will join yours in eternity…
07_04_Lilith_V_DukeRoomEnter8=I may have underestimated you, but now we'll get done with it once and for all.
07_04_Lilith_V_LilithDefeated=Enough playing around!
07_04_Lilith_V_LilithDefeated2=Till next time, gentlemen!
07_04_Hynek_V_LilithDefeated=That damned whore! I knew it!
07_04_Hynek_V_LilithDefeated2=What the devil can't do, he's gonna send a woman to!
07_04_Lothar_V_LilithDefeated=Where is the Duke?
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith=Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Beasts from hell, demons!
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith=Calm down, Duke. She's gone!
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith2=Gone? … How?
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith2=We chased her away. She flew out the window.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith3=Oh, I see… God himself must have sent you to pull me out of those hellish claws.
07_04_Hynek_V__AfterLilith=Not so fast, Duke. You owe us some answers.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith4=And who the hell might you be? Only the Duke decides what he owes and to whom.
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith3=Please excuse him, Your Grace. He is merely a simple man without the required manners.
07_04_Hynek_V__AfterLilith2=But I have…
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith4=Silence!
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith5=I've come to you with an urgent matter. I truly beg your forgiveness for having put you in an embarrassing situation. I hope that what we did to fend off the demon in your bed shall serve as an apology.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith5=So be it then. My thanks to you… My thanks to…
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith6=Lothar von Reichenstein. When I joined the Order, I asked for your permission to transfer all of the family possessions to my sister.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith6=Ah. Of course. Lothar von Reichenstein. I am glad we meet again, even if under such somewhat unfortunate circumstances.
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith7=The unfortunate circumstances are also the reason for my ill-timed visit. My sister Anna has been kidnapped.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith7=Kidnapped? Goodness, who's behind it?
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith8=That woman… demon… it seems that she's behind it. All the leads point here, to Monsterberg.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith8=Oh, what a misfortune! What did I get myself entangled in? Tell me, how might I be able to help you!
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith9=How did you come to know her? How did she manage to get all the way into your bed?
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith9=I had no idea what she was!
07_04_Hynek_V__AfterLilith3=We don't doubt that. Huh.
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith10=Most gracious Duke. Please tell us, where did you get to meet her? What do you know about her? Anything that could possibly help us find my sister.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith10=I shall tell you everything I know! Of course! But it's not going to be much.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith11=A certain priest from Nysa introduced us. A Joachim… Wien… Wan… I can't recall.
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith11=Weinhard!
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith12=Yes! Yes! That's him!
07_04_Hynek_V__AfterLilith4=You know him?
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith12=I've had the honor.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith13=I had some dealings in Nysa and wanted to go to Mass in the Church of the Assumption of Virgin Mary. Their Sunday sermons are famous.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith14=She was standing on the steps in front of the church, speaking to the priest, Joachim Weinhard as you say.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith15=She dropped her handkerchief…
07_04_Hynek_V__AfterLilith5=Well fuck me running, the oldest trick…
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith12_1=Cut it out.
07_04_Hynek_V_AfterLilith2_1=I've got nothing to cut his slimy tongue out with. Could I just beat him to silence instead?
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith12_2=By all the saints! Be quiet!
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith2_1=I picked it up, the priest of course recognized me, and he introduced Lady Lilith to me. We had a lot in common…
07_04_Hynek_V_AfterLilith2_2=She has nice tits and you wanted to get your hands on them.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith2_2=Is this a friend of yours?
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith12_3=No, Your Grace, he's not. Please continue. What did she tell you about herself?
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith2_3=She claimed that she came from Burgundy and that she was traveling through Silesia to learn more about the local customs. Her husband had had some business dealings here… she had been recently widowed, poor lady.
07_04_Hynek_V_AfterLilith2_3=And certainly not for the first time…
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith12_4=Your Grace, can you think of where that monster that deceived you so bad could be hiding?
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith2_4=I have no idea.
07_04_Hynek_V_AfterLilith2_4=Well knock me down with a feather, she negotiated in your name with our side… eeeh, I mean… the Hussites!
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith2_5=What are you saying? I know nothing of that. It's as though I've been spellbound since encountering her in Nysa… Everything is like in a haze.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith2_6=Ahh… Why did God punish me like this?
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith12_5=Calm down, Your Grace. We are not accusing you of anything…
07_04_Hynek_V_AfterLilith2_5=Well, I'm not so sure about that.
07_04_Hynek_V_AfterLilith2_6=What about that Faenard? Where is he now?
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith12_6=Weinhard. I saved him when Nysa fell. He could have fled anywhere!
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith2_7=In front of the Nysa church, he said that he'd often go to contemplate to the monastery in Brieg.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith2_8=That's where he met Lilith. Apparently, she brought some rare relic to the monastery as a gift.
07_04_Hynek_V_AfterLilith2_7=I'll send Faenard to hell if it comes to light that he's had a hand in this as well!
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith2_9=Lord Reichenstein, humility, fasting, and penance would do your companion a lot of good.
07_04_Hynek_V_AfterLilith2_8=Says the guy who fucked the demoness…
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith2_10=I'll have you flogged!
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith12_7=Please forgive him, Your Grace. He is a man of weak intellect. He is temporarily accompanying me but he will soon be heading back to his brethren and shall never bother you again.
07_04_Hynek_V_AfterLilith2_9=Don't make promises you can't keep…
07_04_Lothar_V_AfterLilith12_8=Cut it out.
07_04_Hynek_V_AfterLilith2_10=I'd really like to cut something, believe me.
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_AfterLilith2_11=Be gone now, I have to go to the chapel. To pray and confess.
07_04_Lothar_V_DukeLeaving=A moment, Your Grace. Have you heard of what happened in Little Oels?
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_DukeLeaving=A terrible tragedy. I will be praying for your brethren…
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_DukeLeaving2=I'm sure the Hussite heretics will burn in hell for what they did.
07_04_Hynek_V_DukeLeaving=I was starting to worry that no one would utter this sentence…
07_04_Lothar_V_DukeLeaving2=Beneath the monastery, they hid…
07_04_Hynek_V_DukeLeaving2=Cut it out!
07_04_Lothar_V_DukeLeaving3=Don't interrupt me!
07_04_Hynek_V_DukeLeaving3=Cut it out in deed, young man! We need to cut this she-demon out into little pieces!
07_04_Hynek_V_DukeLeaving4=Now say a nice goodbye to His Grace…
07_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_Escape=Guards! Catch them! Cut out their tongues and then hang them right away!
07_04_Lothar_V_Escape=I'm a nobleman!
07_04_Hynek_V_Escape=Would you rather be beheaded, you idiot?
07_04_Lothar_V_Escape2=What is going on? Your Grace…
07_04_Hynek_V_Escape2=His Grace is involved in all of this, you smart-ass!
07_04_Hynek_V_Escape3=We're getting out of here. Quick!
07_05_Countdown=Time until the city gates close
07_05_CountdownGameOverReason=The city gates have closed
07_05_AccessibilityCut5=You rode through the gate out of the city.
07_05_Gameover=You have been caught
07_05_Lothar_V_Escape=Hynek! Horses! Hurry!
07_05_Lothar_V_Escape2=And now let's blaze out of this town like a bolt of lightning, before they can close the gates! Ride behind me and don't let them knock you off the horse!

08_01_Intro_Cut=<b>Friday, March 26, 1428</b><br>A forest path, a stone's throw from Brieg, Silesia
08_01_AccessibilityLevelDescription=You are riding along a forest path. There are just trees around.
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein=What was the name of that castle of yours again? Reichenstein? That sounds familiar…
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein=Well, you're the first one to have ever told me this.
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein2=I thought you came from a respected family?
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein2=My grandfather was a bastard of bastards. So much for the respected family, Hynek.
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein3=There's plenty of those around, don't sweat over it, hero of Nysa.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein3=You're pulling my leg!
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein4=You can draw your steel then! (laughter)
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein5=Reichenstein… Where could I have heard that?
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein4=Well, you can't shut people's mouths.
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein6=Such words from a man of faith? I have a bad influence on you. You'll start calling me brother in a bit… (laughter)
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein7=So, spit it out, which family's stray seed are you, and why do people gossip about you?
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein5=I'm from the Opava branch of the Premyslid dynasty.
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein8=Oh, bloody hell! Maybe I should leap off the horse and kneel down, my lord? (laughter)
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein6=I'm not going to tell you anything more!
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein9=Fuck my arse, I saved your backside from that hellish bitch, you almost stood up to your own people for me, but you immediately make a fuss about everything like a virgin.
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein10=Well, I do take it seriously…
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein11=Someone like you, honest, capable and clever, could easily stand in the front of the Opavians, and not hide away in the forests at Reichenstein. What happened?
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein7=Grandfather was in deed one of the respected men among the Opavians, but he had buried two wives and had no descendants.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein8=He was about to witness his fiftieth spring when he met a young beauty in the Opavian lower castle on the day of the harvest supper.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein9=They'd warned him of her, saying she was a witch, but alas…
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein12=The old man dusted off his horns, and a disaster was laid, right.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein10=Or rather my father. But you're right, he fell in love.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein11=When she conceived, he admitted her for a wife.
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein13=I assume it didn't take place after a church announcement.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein12=Right. As though you knew the story…
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein13=At last, he had to flee Opava and buy off Reichenstein from some bandits in the greatest secrecy.
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein14=And then something got fucked up. It's usually like that in every fairy-tale.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein14=It took two decades. Grandfather passed away and father got married himself. This time including the proper announcements, and in a church.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein15=My elder brother was born…
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein16=Even for him alone, father began to strive to get back among the hereditary nobility. The possessions left after my grandfather were grand in deed.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein17=He handed out a couple bribes here and there in order to be given the opportunity as well as to demonstrate his skills.
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein16=And the greatest hindrance to his ambition was his own mother. I'm sure I'm not wrong on that.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein18=The pox sprang up in the lower castle, and father accused her of either having summoned it directly, or of this being God's punishment for her unsanctified marriage with grandfather.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein19=When even his wife and little son were struck with the disease, the old woman promised she would heal them both, but father ordered in his anger to have her shackled and build a stake for her.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein20=What was next, no one knows. Perhaps the old woman bewitched everyone.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein21=She vanished as though she had never set foot in the hall… And along with her, father's first born son also went missing, who had just turned three.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein22=They've never been found…
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein23=Father's first wife died from the pox and father had to give up on his plans of returning to Opava. Nothing spreads as fast as human gossip.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein24=Years passed, father got married again, and from this marriage came Anna and me.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein25=However, both of us are still marked with the burden of what had happened.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein26=I joined the order in rebellion against the father who'd never ceased to think back on my elder step-brother.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein27=The family possessions were left to my sister in their entirety, and I long for their sheer size to hopefully overpower the murmurs of witch blood, and for her to soon enter a good marriage.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein28=So… Now you know everything about the house of Reichenstein.
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein17=Thank you… For your honesty.
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein18=But fret not over the past!
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein19=As for me, I grew up at the court of Jobst of Luxembourg himself!
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein20=Only my grandmother took care of me. She was his court healer and it was her duty to ensure no one would attempt to cast him out of this world with poison.
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein21=There is no doubt she was also a witch!
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein22=I never knew my parents, but grandmother once let it slip that I was connected to Jobst by the same blood. That of mine was boiling and steaming though!
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein23=I yearned to become one of his blades. Jobst, that would have been a heck of a king for Bohemia! Well, screw Bohemia, Jobst was king of the Romans, and… and I'm stuck with you…
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein23b=Fuck the past! May devil seize the ancestors, Lothar…
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein29=Don't you speak blasphemy!
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein24=Let the horns blow, let the wine flow!
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein25=And let a whore do her feints on me, by all the saints. Let a whore do her feints on me, by all the saints.
08_01_Lothar_V_Reichenstein30=What an awful earworm. Won't be able to get it out of my head till nightfall…
08_01_Hynek_V_Reichenstein26=(whistling)
08_02_Intro_Cut=Dominican Monastery of the Holy Cross<br>Brieg, Silesia
08_02_AccessibilityDescriptionCity=You are in the deserted streets of the Brieg town, not far from the Dominican monastery.
08_02_AccessibilityDescriptionMonastery=You are within the premises of the Dominican monastery. You can see the large main building, the graveyard surrounded with a low wall, and also a church.
08_02_AccessibilityDescriptionGraveyard=You are at the graveyard within the premises of the Dominican monastery. There are roughly several dozen graves. In one of the corners, you can see a stone crypt.
08_02_AccessibilityMarkerMainGate=Main gate of the monastery
08_02_AccessibilityMarkerGraveyard=Monastery graveyard
08_02_AccessibilityMarkerMainBuilding=Main building of the monastery
08_02_AccessibilityMarkerTownSquare=Town square
08_02_AccessibilityCut=Suddenly, Joachim ran out of one of the doors.
08_02_CryptDoor=Crypt door
08_02_Hynek_V_Monastery=It's quiet and barren here, like a graveyard.
08_02_Hynek_V_Monastery2=Hey, you! Where's everyone?
08_02_Lothar_V_Monastery=It's no good. Leave him be. They've fled the town. From your lot…
08_02_Lothar_V_Monastery2=The army is bound to be nearby. We've got to hurry.
08_02_Lothar_V_Monastery3=We're here.
08_02_Lothar_V_Monastery4=Let's hope we're lucky.
08_02_Lothar_V_WrongWayCity=We have to head for the monastery. And certainly not this way.
08_02_Dominican_V_Dominican=Halt! The monastery is closed. You must leave.
08_02_Lothar_V_Dominican=We come in an urgent matter, honorable brother.
08_02_Dominican_V_Dominican2=I am Sulan the sub-prior.
08_02_Lothar_V_Dominican2=My apologies, Your Reverence.
08_02_Lothar_V_Dominican_Silence=…
08_02_Lothar_V_Dominican_Joachim=We're looking for a certain Joachim Weinhard.
08_02_Lothar_V_Dominican_Joachim2=He is said to be a guest here at the monastery.
08_02_Lothar_V_Dominican_Prior=Would it be possible for us to speak to the prior?
08_02_Dominican_V_Dominican_Prior=The prior and others have already set off for Saint Adalbert in Wrocław. And I am leaving right now.
08_02_Dominican_V_Dominican_Prior2=There is no one else here.
08_02_Lothar_V_Dominican_Around=Would you mind us taking a bit of a look around here, Your Reverence?
08_02_Dominican_V_Dominican_Around=Well, I most certainly would. I'm locking the gate and leaving.
08_02_Dominican_V_Dominican_Around2=And I recommend you, Hospitaller, to do the same.
08_02_Hynek_V_Dominican_AroundHynek=May I say something as well?
08_02_Lothar_V_Dominican_AroundHynekSilence=…
08_02_Hynek_V_Dominican_AroundHynek2=Let us enter, or I'll crush your skull and dance upon your corpse.
08_02_Dominican_V_Dominican_AroundHynek=Who the heck are you? Leave the premises of the monastery immediately.
08_02_Lothar_V_Dominican_AroundHynekNo=No.
08_02_Lothar_V_Dominican_Anna=It is a matter of life and death! My sister is in danger.
08_02_Dominican_V_Dominican_Anna=That's most unfortunate, no doubt, but I cannot help you.
08_02_Lothar_V_Dominican_Hussites=Are you leaving because of the Hussites?
08_02_Dominican_V_Dominican_Hussites=The army of heretics is but a mile away from the town.
08_02_Dominican_V_Dominican_Hussites2=All the burghers ran away, there's no reason to stay.
08_02_Lothar_V_Dominican_Brothers=Do you know anything about my brothers in Brieg?
08_02_Dominican_V_Dominican_Brothers=The commandery has been closed for several days. Obviously, your brothers had more wits than you.
08_02_Lothar_V_Dominican_Finished=All right. We're going.
08_02_Dominican_V_Dominican_End=Leave the premises of the monastery, please.
08_02_Dominican_V_Dominican_End2=I'll lock the gate behind you.
08_02_Dominican_V_Leaving=How on earth… How dare you! Now… be off with you!
08_02_Dominican_V_Leaving2=Ah… May God have mercy on you!
08_02_Dominican_V_LeavingEnd=God be with you, honorable brothers. I shall pray for you.
08_02_Hynek_V_Dominican_LeavingEnd=Hmm… And what now?
08_02_Lothar_V_EnterFinished=That's done.
08_02_Hynek_V_Joachim=There!
08_02_Lothar_V_Joachim=That's him!
08_02_JoachimCountdown=Time until Joachim gets out of range
08_02_JoachimCountdownGameOver=Joachim Weinhard got out of range
08_02_Lothar_V_GravestoneExamine=The gravestone says…
08_02_Lothar_V_GravestoneExamine2=Here lies forever, with God's blessing, beloved mother Sarah Schlessing.
08_02_Lothar_V_GravestoneExamine3=She was not to see her offspring live, yet her love to them she'll always give.
08_03_AccessibilityDescriptionOssuary=You are in the underground area of the crypt which serves as an ossuary. You can see large musty corridors covered in omnipresent skeletal remains. Some of them are carefully arranged or placed in vessels, others just scattered about.
08_03_AccessibilityDescriptionChapel=You are in the black chapel hidden in the back area of the ossuary.
08_03_AccessibilityDescriptionDungeons=You are in the Brieg underground. The twisting maze of various corridors leads into the individual houses and their respective cellars.
08_03_AccessibilityDescriptionCellarA=You've entered one of the cellars. It's full of various barrels. Some of them are placed on wooden stands, stacked up all the way to the ceiling.
08_03_AccessibilityDescriptionCellarB=You are in the cellar which is probably connected to one of the Brieg burgher's houses. There are bags with vegetables and various other supplies.
08_03_AccessibilityDescriptionCellarC=The cellar that you are standing in is one big mess. Broken barrels, boxes, cobwebs and dust all around make it obvious that no one has set foot down here for years.
08_03_AccessibilityDescriptionCellarD=You are standing in a tidy, cozy cellar which was probably used by someone in Brieg as a secret alchemist workshop.
08_03_AccessibilityDescriptionCellarChurch=You got into a crypt which certainly does not look unused. On the contrary. It's probably connected to one of the Brieg churches.
08_03_JoachimWeinhard_V_Joachim=To the devil with you! Where'd you come from, both of you?
08_03_JoachimWeinhard_V_Joachim2=Brothers in arms, side by side. How did you get to know about me?
08_03_JoachimWeinhard_V_Joachim3=I suppose you crushed Lilith's wings a little, and that bitch gave me up?
08_03_JoachimWeinhard_V_Joachim4=I see the world has turned into a stinking arse and it's time to save my own skin.
08_03_Lothar_V_Joachim=Freeze, you traitor from hell. Confession is imminent!
08_03_Hynek_V_Joachim=Fuck it, don't you move an inch, Faenard! We've got something to settle with you!
08_03_JoachimWeinhard_V_Joachim5=Oh, how the little birds tweet together, as though they fell out of a single nest.
08_03_JoachimWeinhard_V_Joachim6=Wait a moment, and your cage will fall upon you.
08_03_JoachimWeinhard_V_Joachim7=You nearly clipped my wings here, the ground will be safer to tread at the Cistercians in Kamenz.
08_03_Hynek_V_Joachim2=Tell me, what do you know about that hellish whore Lilith?
08_03_Lothar_V_Joachim2=Where is my sister Anna?
08_03_JoachimWeinhard_V_Joachim8=Whore or Saint, I'll be meeting both in no time.
08_03_JoachimWeinhard_V_Joachim9=As for you, my darlings are sharpening their teeth for you.
08_03_JoachimWeinhard_V_Joachim10=Without life and without fear, up you get, my bony dear…
08_03_JoachimWeinhard_V_Joachim11=(laughter)
08_03_JoachimWeinhard_V_Joachim12=(laughter)
08_03_Lothar_V_WrongWayMonastery=Can't go back yet. Have to find Weinhard first.
08_03_Lothar_V_DeadEnd=It ends here. There's nowhere to proceed!
08_03_Hynek_V_DeadEnd=Fuck that. You'll come up with something, you're educated!
08_03_Hynek_V_DeadEnd2=Make it quick, though, or we're goners!
08_03_Hynek_V_Organ=What the fuck is that racket? Some hellish organ?
08_03_Lothar_V_Organ=God be the judge.
08_03_Hynek_V_Organ2=Keep God out of this now. That warlock must have fled somehow. This definitely serves some purpose.
08_03_Hynek_V_Organ3=Try to play something. I'll keep them away from you for now!
08_03_Hynek_V_Hurry1=Oh come on!
08_03_Hynek_V_Hurry2=You done yet?
08_03_Hynek_V_Hurry3=By all the fucking bitches, do get a move on already.
08_03_Hynek_V_Hurry4=Hey, you see we have a problem here? Could you maybe solve it already?
08_03_Hynek_V_Hurry5=So how's it going? You done yet?
08_03_Lothar_V_Hurry1=We can switch places any time!
08_03_Lothar_V_Hurry2=Let me think!
08_03_Lothar_V_Hurry3=I'm doing all I can!
08_03_Lothar_V_Hurry4=I'm trying!
08_03_Lothar_V_Hurry5=God help me.
08_03_Lothar_V_PipesExamine=Four copper pipes. The windbag will probably be hidden underneath them.
08_03_Lothar_V_WallDoorExamine=This is where the passage leads onwards, for sure. But how do I open it?
08_03_Lothar_V_AltarExamine=The unholy altar where the necromancy rites were probably being prepared. God save me!
08_03_Lothar_V_AltarExamine2=I can't see anything that would help us here.
08_03_Lothar_V_StoneVesselExamine=There's blood and remnants of corpses inside. By all the angels, where did we get to?
08_03_Lothar_V_TextExamine=It reads…
08_03_Lothar_V_TextExamine2=Non est sine morte vita, sine tenebra lux, sine altitudine profunditas.
08_03_Lothar_V_TextExamine3=There is no life without death, no light without darkness, there is no low without high.
08_03_Lothar_V_TextExamine4=Could this help me?
08_03_Hynek_V_DeadEndFinished=Per aspera ad astra.
08_03_Hynek_V_DeadEndFinished2=What are you gawking at? Even a layman may be able to read Vergilius in the original.
08_03_Hynek_V_Cellars=Watch out! That warlock may have hidden in one of the cellars.
08_03_Hynek_V_Cellar=Seems to me that Silesia is no longer within God's sight. All just dark tricks in here.
08_03_Hynek_V_Cellar2=Is some alchemist hiding their potions and brews here?
08_03_Lothar_V_Thunder=What was that?
08_04_AccessibilityCut=Lothar and Hynek are walking up the staircase leading into the local church.
08_04_AccessibilityCut2=Lothar runs back down.
08_04_BlazekKralup_V_Hussites=Stop struggling like a fish on dry ground, or I'll be glad to gift you with another kick!
08_04_DobesPuchala_V_Hussites=Who the hell has come to see us now? Aren't you supposed to be spying on that woman in Monsterberg?
08_04_Divis_V_Hussites=Or has perhaps God's providence come into play here, handing us the renegade?
08_04_Hynek_V_Hussites=Brothers! Good to see you. You arrived sooner than I expected, and in good time as I can see. We were just following this swine of a priest.
08_04_BlazekKralup_V_Hussites2=This warlock worm? He was throwing bolts of lightning at us and he killed three men before we were able to grab him and stuff a gag into his mouth.
08_04_Slama_V_Hussites=Who have you made alliances with, Hynek? Have you lost your mind?
08_04_Divis_V_Hussites2=He's succumbed to dark magic! Kneeel down and do penance, sinner!
08_04_Hynek_V_Hussites2=I haven't made any alliances with anyone. I was following that Lilith to Monsterberg. You won't believe what I and Lothar…
08_04_Slama_V_Hussites2=What Lothar? What on earth are you babbling about?
08_04_Divis_V_Hussites3=He's held hands with the Devil! Look at what he's wearing. The Crusader has recruited him!
08_04_Hynek_V_Hussites4=Straw, Father, brothers, I can explain everything!
08_04_Slama_V_Hussites3=Not a single word, or I'll run you through sooner than you can say Judas Iscariot!
08_04_Hynek_V_Hussites5=Am I seeing things, or has that Faenard put a spell on me? What is going on?
08_04_DobesPuchala_V_Hussites2=Not just a drunk but also a traitor. I've always thought so!
08_04_Hynek_V_Hussites6=But…
08_04_BlazekKralup_V_Hussites4=Catch Hynek, tie him up, and throw down alongside the mage. The Hospitaller knight, kill him right away!
08_04_Hynek_V_Hussites6b=Run, Lothar, run!
08_04_Hynek_V_Hussites7=What the heck is wrong with you all?
08_04_AccessibilityCut3=Lothar leapt into the saddle and swiftly kicked the horse in the loins. It galloped away, leaving a cloud of dust behind.

09_01_Cut=<b>Still Friday, 26 March, 1428</b><br>Hussite camp near Olawa, Silesia<br>Just before sunset
09_01_AccessibilityDescription=They put you, gagged and tied up, into a prison cell in the Hussite encampment, at the back of the wagon fort. It's dark, the Moon is shining. Light from torches and nearby fireplaces also reaches the cell.
09_01_Hussite_V_Intro=Take a nap here, so that you're well rested for the branch swinging tomorrow.

09_01_Hussite_V_Noise2=Fuck, don't piss me off! You want a rock in your face? Be quiet!
09_01_Hussite_V_Noise3=You asked for it! Catch! If you don't stop it, you're gonna get a beating!
09_01_Hussite_V_Noise4=Want another one? Here you go, asshole! And shut up already.
09_01_Rock=Rock
09_01_Hynek_V_GagRemoved=Yuck… Finally. What a relief.
09_01_Hynek_V_TryLegsRemove=I'll keep the ropes on my legs for now.
09_01_Hynek_V_TryLegsRemove2=If a guard comes to investigate, I'll put my hands behind my back and be done with it. But he'd spot the unrestrained legs right away.
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimGag=We need to talk, Faenard.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_HynekGag=You'll find it easier to talk without the gag.
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimGagRemoved=I'll take it off, but you're gonna be a good boy, Faenard, okay?
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimGagRemoved2=Or else I'll shove that rock down your throat.
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimTalkIntro=So, we ended up in the same cage together, and tomorrow we'll both be shuffling our feet in the air.
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimTalkIntro2=Don't you think it's time you told me what's going on?
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalkIntro=Anything you want… That bitch Lilith threw me overboard anyway.
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimTalk_Silence=…
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Silence=…
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimTalk_Lilith=Why is Lilith after me? What does she have against me?
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Lilith=You know nothing, Hynek of Moravia.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Lilith2=Lilith has tamed the Clairvoyant, who can read the minds of all men as if they were books.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Lilith3=He advises and warns her. He may not see anything, but he still sees everything. The past, and countless possible futures.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Lilith4=Anna was discovered because the Clairvoyant could not see into her mind. And from her, she learned about you and Lothar. Your minds can't be read either.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Lilith5=She ordered me to kill Lothar back in Nysa. I set a trap, but I underestimated his power.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Lilith6=And you crossed her path on Rabesberg as you pursued her minion there.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Lilith7=Since then, she has been trying to get you both out of the way.
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimTalk_Clairvoyant=Where has she hidden that Clairvoyant of hers? How do I find him?
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Clairvoyant=She recently arranged a new place for him to live at Sobath.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Clairvoyant2=There's this little wooden keep there.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Clairvoyant3=But don't count on being able to get to him. You'll soon be chirping away on a branch, remember.
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimTalk_DevilsMountain=Is this Lilith of Devil's Mountain really who I think she is?
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_DevilsMountain=A demoness as old as the world, the first wife of Adam. She has rebelled against God and his will, and is taking vengeance on all his creations for what he has done to her.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_DevilsMountain2=She does come from the Devil's Mountain indeed, but from within it. There is a passageway to Hell itself there.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_DevilsMountain3=The Devil sent her to this realm to prepare the ground for the expansion of his empire. She was to find the stone cursed by the wrath of God, and use it to open other portals through which hordes of demons could reach this realm.
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimTalk_JohnMonsterberg=What is Lilith's plan now and how does it relate to John of Monsterberg?
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_JohnMonsterberg=I'd say the Devil knows, but he probably has no idea because Lilith has started pursuing her own goals.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_JohnMonsterberg2=She has joined forces with John of Monsterberg. They chirp together like two lovebirds, and are planning a rebellion. Not here, in Hell!
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_JohnMonsterberg3=They're going to dethrone the Devil himself. That's why I had to retrieve the Spear of Destiny for her from the Templar's hideout in Little Oels.
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimTalk_JohnMonsterberg2=That was you, you snakehead?!
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_JohnMonsterberg4=Only the blood of the Savior himself has such power.
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimTalk_Anna=Why has Lilith kidnapped Anna of Reichenstein?
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Anna=Even the oldest demoness is still just a stupid woman. She fell in love. And she wants to give her lover the heir his God denied him.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Anna2=But for that, she needs to seize a new young body first.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Anna3=The process would kill a mere mortal woman, but Anna is different. She has a witch's blood in her.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Anna4=Lilith is going to suck the soul out of her body and then claim it to conceive a child with John of Monsterberg.
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimTalk_Anna2=Yuck! That's disgusting, my goodness.
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimTalk_Final=By all the saints! Do they both want to sit on the throne of Hell, or what?
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Final=They do, but neither one can! (laughter)
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Final2=That's why they need Anna and the heir they will produce through her womb.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Final3=Only he will be able to sit on the Devil's throne.
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Final4=Anna is descended from ancient noble blood mixed with magic from a witch grandmother. Doesn't her brother know that Anna has oracular dreams and can even cast magic through them?
09_01_JoachimWeinhard_V_JoachimTalk_Final5=Or are you… (laughter) you fool, under the impression that here in Silesia we have unicorns running around the woods for nothing? (laughter)
09_01_Hynek_V_JoachimTalk_Final2=Are you saying that…
09_01_Hussite_V_JoachimTaken=So, a little change of plans. Get up, you swine, the boys want to get a bonfire going.
09_01_Hussite_V_JoachimTaken2=Where's your gag? Ah, doesn't matter. Let's go!
09_02_AccessibilityCut=Dark. The faint outline of a shining silhouette can be seen nearby.
09_02_AccessibilityCut2=Hynek opened his eyes and gave a start. Something is bending down over him.
09_02_AccessibilityCut3=Hynek noticed the creature bending down over a sleeping Hussite.
09_02_AccessibilityCut4=The demon's skin burns, and then it falls to the ground dead. Hynek arrives at it and bends down over its corpse.
09_02_AccessibilityCut5=In the commander's tent.
09_02_Anna_V_Dream1=Hynek…
09_02_Anna_V_Dream2=Hynek…
09_02_Anna_V_Dream3=Hynek… Get up.
09_02_Anna_V_Dream4=Hynek… Hynek… You need to wake up now.
09_02_Anna_V_Dream5=Wake up…
09_02_Anna_V_Dream6=Wake up…
09_02_Anna_V_Dream7=Now!
09_02_Hynek_V_Dream=Oh crap!
09_02_Hynek_V_Dream2=I'm not having a moment's peace, not even in jail… What the hell is that thing now?!
09_02_Hynek_V_Dream3=It changed colours… And used the surroundings to disguise itself.
09_02_Hynek_V_ChestItems=My stuff… It's all here.
09_02_Hynek_V_Watch1=Dammit! Are the sentries snoring too? Like that, right here on the ground?
09_02_Hynek_V_Watch2=Another sleeping sentry!
09_02_Hynek_V_WeaponAcquired=The brothers want to hang me. If I had any common sense, I'd wave them goodbye.
09_02_Hynek_V_WeaponAcquired2=But my honor won't let me, I have to find out what kind of shapeshifting beast this is.
09_02_Hynek_V_ExamineCorpse=So you see, Faenard, where you've ended up.
09_02_Hynek_V_ExamineCorpse2=And you were so passionate about your cause…
09_02_Hynek_V_WakeUpPuchala=Brother Dobeslav, wake up! There's a monster here. I'm gonna need your help!
09_02_Hynek_V_WakeUpDivis=Father, get up! By all the saints, you must wake up!
09_02_Hynek_V_WakeUpSlama=Straw! Wake up, buddy! You're not gonna let me down, are you! Hey!
09_02_Hynek_V_WakeUpProkop=Prokop! Prokop! Wake up…
09_02_Hynek_V_WakeUpHussite1=Hey! Wake up…
09_02_Hynek_V_WakeUpHussite2=Get up! Don't you sleep…
09_02_Hynek_V_WakeUpHussite3=Brother! Wake up!
09_02_Hynek_V_WakeUpHussite1b=This is useless. He's sleeping soundly…
09_02_Hynek_V_WakeUpHussite2b=I don't think I can wake him up…
09_02_Hynek_V_WakeUpHussite3b=He's still sound asleep…
09_02_Hynek_V_WakeUp1=Why can't I wake them?
09_02_Hynek_V_WakeUp2=Is it the bitch's fault? Is it some kind of enchantment?
09_02_Hynek_V_Demon=What is the creature trying to do?
09_02_Hynek_V_Demon2=Granny once told me about a nightmare… A demon that enters people's dreams. Could this be it?!
09_02_Hynek_V_Demon3=Once it takes possession of a sleeper, it sucks in all the memories and then uses them against him. It uses the dreams to influence what he does during the daytime! That would explain the brothers' strange behavior.
09_02_Hynek_V_Light=It's afraid of the light!
09_02_Hynek_V_Light2=I could use that…
09_02_Hussite_V_Awakening=Ouch… My head. What happened?
09_02_Hussite2_V_Awakening=I was asleep on guard duty? Why was I sleeping? I didn't want to sleep!
09_02_ProkopHoly_V_AfterDemon=So… Everyone seems to be awake and well now.
09_02_DobesPuchala_V_AfterDemon=Except for the nagging headache.
09_02_ProkopHoly_V_AfterDemon2=I can't really describe what that was. Suddenly my head was filled with the strange thoughts.
09_02_Hynek_V_AfterDemon=I think it was the nightmare. A demon granny once told me about.
09_02_Divis_V_AfterDemon=God protect us!
09_02_ProkopHoly_V_AfterDemon3=A demon? I thought nightmare was the name for a bad dream.
09_02_Hynek_V_AfterDemon1=That doesn't just appear out of nowhere though. It's brought upon you by a nightmare that sits on you.
09_02_ProkopHoly_V_AfterDemon4=You must tell me everything you know about it. The field troops were under considerable threat. I had the urge to just turn around and take Prague by storm.
09_02_ProkopHoly_V_AfterDemon5=And I almost had a noose put around your neck.
09_02_DobesPuchala_V_AfterDemon1=On the other hand, at least he stayed sober for a while with the gag in his mouth.
09_02_Hynek_V_AfterDemon1b=I'm glad, Brother Dobeslav, that you are relieved and your sense of humor is returning!
09_02_Hynek_V_AfterDemon2=There is much more I have to tell you, Prokop.
09_02_Hynek_V_AfterDemon3=Mostly about what I've learned in Monsterberg and Brieg…
09_02_ProkopHoly_V_AfterDemon6=But first we'll send for reinforcements. I don't like this at all.
09_02_ProkopHoly_V_AfterDemon7=Dobeslav, take care of it! Send riders to Bohemia. If our people haven't set out yet, they should do so as soon as possible.
09_02_DobesPuchala_V_AfterDemon2=I'm on it!
09_02_Hynek_V_AfterDemon4=The crusader Lothar was with me. What happened to him?
09_02_ProkopHoly_V_AfterDemon8=His fate is dear to your heart? He disappeared into our dungeons. A patrol reported seeing him riding away on horseback.
09_02_ProkopHoly_V_AfterDemon9=Who is he?
09_02_Hynek_V_AfterDemon5=It's a long story… Where to start?
09_02_Hynek_V_AfterDemon6=As I walked out of the cave through the magical portal…

10_01_Lothar_V_Arrival1=At last… the monastery gate.
10_01_Lothar_V_Arrival2=It's still long until the morning Mass, but I can't wait. I have to wake the monks.
10_01_Lothar_V_CrossExamine=Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner…
10_01_Lothar_V_CrossExamine2=… and guide my steps, and help me to find my sister alive and well.
10_01_Cistercian_V_Door=Coming! Well, there's not a fire around, is there!
10_01_Cistercian_V_Greetings=Jesus Christ be praised.
10_01_Lothar_V_Greetings=In saecula saeculorum! Amen.
10_01_Cistercian_V_Greetings2=What urgent issue has led a Saint John's knight into our monastery at such an early hour?
10_01_Cistercian_V_Greetings3=Perhaps you're coming to warn us of the approaching heretics?
10_01_Lothar_V_Greetings2=Do not worry, venerable brother. As far as I know, the Hussite army is up north, all the way at Brieg. It's that monastery that I'm just coming from.
10_01_Cistercian_V_Greetings4=Do come on then, so that you may reveal the reason for your arrival to us.
10_01_Cistercian2_V_Monastery=Who's arrived, brother? What happened?
10_01_Cistercian_V_Monastery=There's a Saint John's knight. Likely under urgent circumstances.
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery=I am Lothar, venerable brothers.
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery2=Trust me, it displeases me greatly to have disturbed your sleep, but I really couldn't have waited until morn.
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery_Silence=…
10_01_Cistercian_V_Silence=Are you going to tell us why you're here at last?
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery_Investigation=I was pursuing a certain priest, Joachim Weinhard.
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery_Investigation2=Turns out he was involved in dark magic, and I have a well founded suspicion that he may have been in contact with someone here in the monastery.
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery_Investigation3=I am here to investigate it.
10_01_Cistercian_V_Monastery_Investigation=Hmm… Investigate, you say?
10_01_Cistercian_V_Monastery_Investigation2=And whose decrees may you be having, that you dare give orders here?
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery_Investigation4=I…
10_01_Cistercian2_V_Monastery_Investigation=Brother, I think we should introduce Lothar to certain significant guests of our monastery.
10_01_Cistercian_V_Monastery_Investigation3=I agree… Brother Skai, the trapdoor!
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery_Joachim=I am a good friend of Joachim Weinhard's. He sent me here with a message.
10_01_Cistercian_V_Monastery_End=Hmm… I don't know anyone by this name… Do you, brothers?
10_01_Cistercian2_V_Monastery_End=I don't know who the Hospitaller knight is talking about.
10_01_Cistercian2_V_Monastery_End2=But maybe Elwira could know?
10_01_Cistercian_V_Monastery_End2=Yes. She could in deed.
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery_End=Do you have a woman in the monastery?
10_01_Cistercian_V_Monastery_End3=(laughter) I wouldn't put it that way exactly. You'll see for yourself…
10_01_Cistercian_V_Monastery_End4=Brother Skai, the trapdoor!
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery_Sister=I'm looking for my sister Anna. The clues have led me to you.
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery_Silesia=I'm here because of top secret dealings, on which depends the fate of the entire Silesia.
10_01_Cistercian_V_Monastery_Silesia=Secret dealings, you say? I'm all ears.
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery_Silesia2=I can reveal everything only to the monastery superior.
10_01_Cistercian_V_Monastery_Silesia2=I'm sorry, but the prior cannot talk to you right now. He's dealing with some more immediate matters.
10_01_Cistercian_V_Monastery_Silesia3=You'll have to make do with us.
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery_Lilith=I'm looking for a certain noblewoman. Lilith of Devil's Mountain.
10_01_Lothar_V_Monastery_NoMoreGames=Enough of these games. Weinhard told me everything! Where's the Lilith beast and my sister?!
10_02_AccessibilityCut=Lothar fell in water, but got up right away. He quickly turns his head from side to side. Something is in here with him.
10_02_AccessibilityDescription=You are in the sewers located below the Cistercian monastery. You don't even dare to think of what all might be floating in the smelly water all around you.

10_02_Lothar_V_Trap2=I have to get back up to the surface and find Anna.
10_03_AccessibilityDescription=You are in a secret monastery cellar above the sewers. The light-colored walls are complemented by the floor paved with red tiles, and massive columns.

10_03_AccessibilityMarkerSouthSewer=Southern staircase into the sewers

10_03_AccessibilityDescriptionWork=You are probably in some sort of study. There is a large stone desk with an ink-well, scattered papers and books.
10_03_AccessibilityDescriptionSurgery=The room around you resembles a twisted hospital. You can see stone desks with dissected female bodies, as well as ceramic vessels full of entrails and blood.
10_03_AccessibilityDescriptionSecretRoom=You've reached a secret room with magical symbols and sunken floor. Through the hole, you can peer into the sewers.
10_03_AccessibilityDescriptionChapel=You are in a strange room full of magical symbols on the walls. Besides them, there is a large raised stone pedestal, and burning candles litter the staircase that leads to it.
10_03_AccessibilityDescriptionBigRoom=The area around you looks majestic. Its main feature is a strange bronze pentagram on the floor and an altar, the path to which is littered with statues of demons and decorated stone pillars.
10_03_AccessibilityDescriptionDemonRoom=You are in a large triangle-shaped area. The ceiling is supported with six massive pillars. There is a strange altar straight in front of the entrance, and small cages by the walls.
10_03_AccessibilityCut=As soon as Lothar entered, the fiery wall sprang back into flames right behind him. Now he stands face to face with a winged and horned demon that towers twice above his height.
10_03_AccessibilityCut2=The ceiling started crumbling, until it collapsed and buried the demon. Lothar tried to jump to the wall, out of the way, but he stood no chance.
10_03_Lothar_V_DungeonEnter1=Where the heck am I? Another secret vault?
10_03_Lothar_V_DungeonEnter2=I have to walk through the whole place, room by room… What if they're keeping Anna prisoner here somewhere?
10_03_Lothar_V_CellA1=Prison cells?
10_03_Lothar_V_CellA2=Can God not see what's going on here?
10_03_Lothar_V_CellB1=Dead bodies in shambles, or naked. And just girls and young ladies.
10_03_Lothar_V_CellB2=Holy Mary, Mother of God, what are they doing with them?
10_03_Lothar_V_CellC1=Blood and suffering… What hellish plots are happening here?
10_03_Lothar_V_CellC2=How is it related to the monastery, and why are the monks involved in it?
10_03_Lothar_V_CellD1=More and more cells… Anna, where are you?
10_03_Lothar_V_CellD2=Your brother's coming for you. Everything will be fine again.
10_03_Lothar_V_TortureRoom=The tools around here serve a clear purpose.
10_03_Lothar_V_TortureRoom2=Are they perhaps keeping someone prisoner here to get information out of them?
10_03_Lothar_V_TortureRoom3=Could the Inquisition have something to do with this?
10_03_Lothar_V_SurgeryRoom=You can smell death in the entire underground, but… this is the very doorstep of hell.
10_03_Lothar_V_SurgeryRoom2=Mutilated corpses and ceramic vessels.
10_03_Lothar_V_SurgeryRoom3=They dissect them and preserve the bodily organs? Such godlessness!
10_03_Lothar_V_Storage=Food, barrels with wine and more supplies. And not just here. I passed much more along the corridors.
10_03_Lothar_V_Storage2=This place could hold its own against a siege.
10_03_Lothar_V_ObsidianFirst1=A stone pyramid. Maybe made of obsidian.
10_03_Lothar_V_ObsidianFirst2=I've never seen anything like this before.
10_03_Lothar_V_ObsidianFirst3=It almost looks as though they worship the object.
10_03_Lothar_V_ObsidianSecond1=Another obsidian pyramid? What does it do?
10_03_Lothar_V_ObsidianSecond2=I can feel a strange dark power emanating from it.
10_03_Lothar_V_ObsidianSecond3=Hynek would say that this smells of brimstone.
10_03_Lothar_V_Sword=Saint John, stand by me!
10_03_Lothar_V_Sword2=What witchcraft is this?
10_03_Lothar_V_Scriptorium=Pulpits and plenty of books.
10_03_Lothar_V_Scriptorium2=Do they perhaps initiate their novices into the arts of dark magic here?
10_03_Lothar_V_AlchemistWorkshop=This is unlikely to be a pharmacy, but a true alchemist workshop.
10_03_Lothar_V_AlchemistWorkshop2=They mix not just healing ointments here, but also potions and magical beverages. I might be able to make use of something for a good cause.
10_03_Lothar_V_Quarters=Why would someone sleep in the vaults when they have the entire monastery above their head?
10_03_Lothar_V_Quarters2=Maybe someone up there is not allowed to learn anything about certain people.
10_03_Lothar_V_StairsWrongWay=I'm not going there yet. I have to fully explore the vaults first.
10_03_KamenzScroll1=First scroll of Kamenz
10_03_KamenzScroll1_Text=<br>    On the anniversary of the arrival of our venerable Master Jonas Janczik, new members were admitted into the Fellowship of Asmodeus.<br><br>    Two of them, just as was the case with Master Jonas long ago, came from the University of Prague, and thus they were honored by becoming the first ones to be allowed to undergo the initiation ritual. True to the spirit of Master Jonas's legacy, who was famous for his knowledge, perseverance and swiftness in both words and actions, these novices did in deed come through on our expectations.<br><br>    The secret Fellowship of Asmodeus has been reinforced with half a dozen new souls, in concert with its goals and determined to work on fulfilling them until the world's end, regardless of the sacrifices which are necessary to be made in honor of Asmodeus and in order for our cause to be successful.
10_03_KamenzScroll2=Second scroll of Kamenz
10_03_KamenzScroll2_Text=    Gloomy were our days, and useless all our activities, before the arrival of Asmodeus into our monastery.<br>    Every brother's research was over at the moment of his death, and all his thoughts and experience, so colorful while inside his mind, were turned dull and blank when written down on parchment, as this was not able to provide those who followed in his research with information about the previous discoveries in all their breadth and width.<br>    It was only with Asmodeus and with the establishment of our Fellowship that our plans began to draw closer to reaching their goals. We no longer had to fear deceasing and silencing of thought, for Asmodeus opposes death with his power and returns the souls of our brethren to us.<br>    Those devoted to Asmodeus roam the monastery corridors even after their physical bodies have decomposed, breathing their thoughts into us, supporting our work and guarding Asmodeus's Fellowship on earth in every way possible.
10_03_Lothar_V_KamenzScroll2a=So, it's the cursed souls of the monks who are wandering these halls.
10_03_Lothar_V_KamenzScroll2b=They're struggling against God and death.
10_03_KamenzScroll3=Third scroll of Kamenz
10_03_KamenzScroll3_Text=9 days left until the first full moon of the Spring<br>1428 A. C. - body numero III:<br><br>Female, about 20 years of age, height average, bodily constitution influenced by the lack of sustenance, attributed to being imprisoned for one moon before being sacrificed, died as a sacrifice to Asmodeuss.<br>Compared to the previous body, whose soul went to eternity in the natural way, I have found no differences. I may thus assume that the body is not marked by whether the soul leaves it naturally or it's sacrificed to Asmodeus.<br>The skin is pale, with red to violet blue spots, the bodily stiffness has already initiated. Hair turned grey, nails and teeth broken away, attributed to the terror experienced when the sacrificed soul was sucked out by Asmodeus.<br><br><br>
10_03_KamenzScroll4=Fourth scroll of Kamenz
10_03_KamenzScroll4_Text=    May this record serve to teach future generations about the great success that has been achieved. Asmodeus regularly accepts young virgins from us and willingly rewards us for them with magical power. It took us several years before we were able to contain it within smaller objects. And today, it has finally worked out even with a weapon.<br><br>    The sword that I created with the aid of this power is the best one anyone has ever held in their hand. Incredible firmness and flexibility, a blade which never goes blunt, but above all an enchantment which is capable of lighting a magical flame along its entire length, from the crossguard to the tip.<br><br>    At the right time, the Sword of Eternal Fire, as I named it, shalt become the weapon of the king of the new world. Until then, it shalt be hidden away in an enchanted room by the magical obsidian. He who would like to reach it would not only have to read the spell aloud in front of the secret passageway, but also possess the power to wield the sword.
10_03_Lothar_V_KamenzScroll4a=God save us!
10_03_Lothar_V_KamenzScroll4b=A hellish sword of the king of the new world?
10_03_KamenzScroll5=Scroll with the spell
10_03_KamenzScroll5_Text=The strength that flows through the vein, magical and vicious truly, running from fate is in vain, even if you hate it fully.<br><br>I grasp the hilt with my hand, it's me the sword shall defend. With this weapon you are damned, none shall be left to stand.
10_03_Obsidian=Strange obsidian pyramid
10_03_Lothar_V_Spell1=The strength that flows through the vein, magical and vicious truly.
10_03_Lothar_V_Spell2=Running from fate is in vain, even if you hate it fully.
10_03_Lothar_V_Spell3=I grasp the hilt with my hand, it's me the sword shall defend.
10_03_Lothar_V_Spell4=With this weapon you are damned, none shall be left to stand.
10_03_Lothar_V_VesselExamine=What could this be? Looks like something's missing here.
10_03_Lothar_V_VesselExamine2=Are they holding some wicked rites here, or is it perhaps even an offertory?
10_03_Lothar_V_HellKnight=What beast are you?
10_03_Lothar_V_HellStoneAdd=By all the saints!
10_03_Lothar_V_HellStoneAdd2=The stone flew out of my hand, it sparkled, and it's just kind of floating there!
10_03_Lothar_V_HellStoneExamine=The stones merged together and became covered with a strange substance.
10_03_Lothar_V_HellStoneExamine2=I can feel enormous heat flowing out of it.
10_03_Lothar_V_HellStoneUseFirst=Ouch! My hand.
10_03_Lothar_V_HellStoneUseFirst2=Nearly burned my gloves.
10_03_Lothar_V_HellGate=Hell on earth! Burning air!
10_03_Lothar_V_HellGate2=I've read about magical gates called portals. This looks like one of them.
10_03_Lothar_V_HellGate3=I can't see through to the other side, but this is bound to lead somewhere.
10_03_Lothar_V_Demon=Oh shit…
10_04_Hussite_V_Final=John Kolda! Come here. You've got to see this.
10_04_JohnKolda_V_Final=Another hellish beast?
10_04_Hussite_V_Final2=This one has a cross on his chest. Looks like he's a Hospitaller knight.
10_04_JohnKolda_V_Final2=I'd really like to know what the heck happened here.
10_04_JohnKolda_V_Final3=Damned Silesia. And we've barely been here a week.
10_04_JohnKolda_V_Final4=Pull him out and carry him upstairs. He might tell us something.
10_04_JohnKolda_V_Final5=Brother Kaisberg will then decide what to do with him.
10_04_Hussite_V_Final3=Will do, sir.

11_01_Cut=<b>Sunday, April 4, 1428</b><br>Hussite camp near Reichenbach<br>Morning, before Mass
11_01_CutAccessibility=Hynek walked out of the tent to the pond bank. Straw is chucking rocks into the water.
11_01_CutAccessibility2=Hundreds of Hussites had gathered at the field for Mass. Hynek melted into the crowd.
11_01_Hynek_V_Morning=Ah… What a night again.
11_01_Slama_V_Morning=What's up? Are those dreams still bothering you?
11_01_Hynek_V_Morning2=Granny would say I was cursed, and Lothar's sister is a witch.
11_01_Hynek_V_Morning3=I toss and turn half the night, unable to fall asleep, and when I finally do, Anna calls out to me in my dreams so loudly that it wakes me right back up.
11_01_Slama_V_Morning2=That's good for you. I don't get a girl calling me, not even in my dreams.
11_01_Hynek_V_Morning4=I'll swap with you any day.
11_01_Slama_V_Morning3=No way! I heard of one who couldn't sleep for so long that he finally fell asleep forever from sheer exhaustion.
11_01_Hynek_V_Morning5=Thanks a lot, friend! What a promising prospect…
11_01_Hynek_V_PreArriving=Today, John Kaisberg and his reinforcements from Bohemia will arrive.
11_01_Hynek_V_PreArriving2=As far as I know him, he's been driving the men since dawn to be here in time for Mass. Promises or punishments, just don't be late for the word of God.
11_01_Hussite_V_Arriving=They're coming! Kaisberg is coming!
11_01_Hynek_V_Arriving=Look, reinforcements from Bohemia are here.
11_01_Hynek_V_Pribik_BluePotion=What's the blue potion for?
11_01_Pribik_V_BluePotion=It's a brand new one from the alchemists in Poland.
11_01_Pribik_V_BluePotion2=It'll make you run a mile without getting out of breath. And when you fence, you'll be as fast as a weather vane in a gale.
11_01_Pribik_V_BluePotion3=It just can't make you think faster. I tried it on Straw and he was still just as stupid.
11_01_Hynek_V_Pribik_OrangePotion=Don't you have the orange potions anymore?
11_01_Pribik_V_OrangePotion=Don't even mention it! Someone stole the whole batch. And then Ambrose had the horrible shits. And half the camp after him.
11_01_Pribik_V_OrangePotion2=Prokop prayed it wasn't dysentery. And I wish it wasn't related to the disappearance of the potions.
11_01_Pribik_V_OrangePotion3=Between you and me, Hynek, I think some fucking miscreant poured it into a wine barrel.
11_01_Pribik_V_OrangePotion4=If you're constipated, go pick some plums. I don't mix the orange one anymore, I don't want to get in trouble!
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Shout1=Set up camp on the east side!
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Shout2=Move it! Move it! Mass is about to start!
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Shout3=Whoever's late for Mass, I'll be the one to deal with them, not God!
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Shout4=Come on! You're crawling like a herd of cows.
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_IntroFirst=John Kolda! I'm glad you came with Kaisberg!
11_01_JohnKolda_V_IntroFirst=Hynek! How are you doing? They still haven't killed you?
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Intro=John Kolda!
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Intro=What would you like?
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Silence=…
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Silence=Don't sleep!
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Shrunk=Is it me, or have you shrunk since last time?
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Shrunk=(laughter) And have you grown hair, Hynek? Finally, the rookies will understand that you're only called Fox because of your rust-colored hair. (laughter)
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_GoodToSeeYou=(laughter) Good to see you again!
11_01_JohnKolda_V_GoodToSeeYou=I'll only be glad to see you again if the coins you've owed me since last time are jingling in your pouch!
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_GoodToSeeYou2=I see your humour hasn't left you even under Kaisberg.
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Reminisce=We'll do some reminiscing tonight…
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Reminisce=God forbid! Your reminiscing gives me terrible hangovers!
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Reminisce2=If you had dice, it would be a different way of thinking back. A priest took mine and gave me a sermon on profligacy for them.
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Kralovec=Where is Kaisberg? I can't see him anywhere.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Kralovec=He went ahead… To Prokop.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Kralovec2=Now they're probably discussing tactics.
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Men=How many men have you brought?
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Men=Three thousand warriors.
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Men2=God grant it be enough.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Men2=I heard what you've been through here. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen terrible things along the way myself. Silesia is a cursed land, Hynek.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Men3=We may be living in interesting times.
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Soon=How come you arrived so early from Bohemia?
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Soon=You know Kaisberg, he couldn't wait. We've been on our way to Silesia a week before you sent for us.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Soon2=And it paid off! Kaisberg left me a hostage. Some local nobleman, the family will pay a handsome ransom for him.
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Soon2=I'm happy for you, Kolda.
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Bye=See you later!
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Bye=See you.
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Lothar=I've been to see that hostage of yours!
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Lothar2=I found out I knew him. I owe him a word of honor.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Lothar=(laughter)
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Lothar2=You can't be serious! You owe honor to a crusader? (laughter)
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Lothar3=Tell me, what would it cost me to redeem him from you?
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Lothar3=First pay me the old debt and then we can talk about a new one.
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Lothar4=I don't have that much.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Lothar4=Ask your new friend, maybe he'll lend you some! (laughter)
11_01_JohnKolda_V_FarkleGreatRound1=Just look… Fortune won't shine upon you here.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_FarkleGreatRound2=Good luck to the brave.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_FarkleGreatRound3=Today I have a lucky hand.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_FarkleGreatRound4=(laughter)
11_01_JohnKolda_V_FarkleGreatRound5=When one thing goes well, all things go well…
11_01_JohnKolda_V_FarkleBusted1=Knock me down with a feather!
11_01_JohnKolda_V_FarkleBusted2=I wouldn't say it myself, but I guess I'm lucky in love…
11_01_JohnKolda_V_FarkleBusted3=Fortune, that unfaithful bitch. I knew a lady… Now is not the right time for that.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_FarkleBusted4=Aren't these dice loaded? This game is a disaster.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_FarkleBusted5=I'll shit myself. Fuck it.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_FarkleBusted6=I was born ass-first or what.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_FarkleBusted7=Where there's nothing, not even death thrives.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_FarkleBusted8=This can only happen to me, the Lord God doesn't like me.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_IntroFirst=Damn me! Lothar?
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_IntroFirstKolda=So, you're the hostage of Kolda's?
11_01_Lothar_V_IntroFirst=Hynek! Thank God!
11_01_Lothar_V_IntroFirst2=I was hoping to run into you sooner or later! You must set me free.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Intro=Lothar!
11_01_Lothar_V_Intro=Any news?
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Silence=…
11_01_Lothar_V_Silence=What are you thinking about?
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Captured=For the love of God, how did you get captured?
11_01_Lothar_V_Captured=In Brieg, Joachim Weinhard mentioned the Cistercians in Kamenz, so I set out there.
11_01_Lothar_V_Captured2=But it was a trap. He knew what atrocities were going on in Kamenz, and assumed that if I started asking questions there, they would try to get rid even of me in the blink of an eye. And they almost succeeded.
11_01_Lothar_V_Captured3=I walked through the entire underground area of the monastery to a room closed off by a flaming passage. There was a demon in there, huge like a mountain, to which the monks sacrificed young maidens.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Captured2=Eugh!
11_01_Lothar_V_Captured4=I fought him. Then the ceiling collapsed… I'm a little confused about what happened next…
11_01_Lothar_V_Captured5=It seems I'm a captive, but your Hussite friends saved my life when they dug me out of the ruins.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Kamenz=Did you find Anna in Kamenz?
11_01_Lothar_V_Kamenz=I did not, and I hope Anna was never there in the first place.
11_01_Lothar_V_Kamenz2=If you'd only seen what it looked like in there…
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Joachim=You won't believe what happened to me!
11_01_Lothar_V_Joachim=Tell me, Hynek, I'm dying of curiosity.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Joachim2=After the brothers captured me in the church, they took me and Faenard to the camp outside Olawa.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Joachim3=They locked us up together.
11_01_Lothar_V_Joachim2=And did you manage to find out anything from him?
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Joachim4=When he realized that Lilith had sacrificed him, he spilled almost everything to me.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Joachim5=He's the one behind the ambush on Little Oelz. He directed the slaughter of your brothers and the theft of the Spear of Destiny.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Joachim6=Lilith wants to kill the Devil himself with its blade, and together with John of Monsterberg conceive a child to put on the throne of Hell in his place.
11_01_Lothar_V_Joachim3=Dear God…
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Anna=I keep dreaming about Anna… Every night she calls me and begs for help.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Anna2=Lothar, you have to save me! If I don't get rid of these dreams, this is gonna kill me!
11_01_Lothar_V_Anna=I have no idea where poor Anna might be.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Anna3=I have a new lead. Faenard mentioned a keep called Sobath where Lilith is hiding her Clairvoyant.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Anna4=I'm sure that's the place where your sister is being held captive.
11_01_Lothar_V_Anna2=I wish you were right.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Anna5=We're lucky, Prokop is marching his army to Wrocław and the keep is on the way. Our scouts haven't returned from Sobath, Prokop wants to check it out.
11_01_Lothar_V_Anna3=There's just one hitch… These bars.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Bye=Hang in there, I'll get you out.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Farkle=You couldn't lend me some money, could you?
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Farkle2=I owe Kolda a few coins…
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Farkle3=Roughly the value of two villages…
11_01_Lothar_V_Farkle=Are you mad?!
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Farkle4=He won't even talk to me about you until I pay up.
11_01_Lothar_V_Farkle2=How could something like this happen to you?
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Farkle5=Farkle.
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Farkle6=I've always been more lucky in love… No, I haven't…
11_01_Lothar_V_Farkle3=Sobath… If we save Anna, I can make sure Kolda becomes lord of the keep with all rights that it entails.
11_01_Lothar_V_Farkle4=That must be enough for your debt… But what next?
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Farkle7=Maybe if I played a few games with Kolda, he'd be softened up to negotiate your release…
11_01_Lothar_V_Farkle5=Hynek! You can't be thinking of… You can't play Farkle for me!
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Farkle8=That's an idea!
11_01_Hynek_V_Lothar_Farkle9=But where am I gonna get some dice now? Loaded ones at best, I can't leave Lothar's life at the mercy of fortune.
11_01_Hynek_V_Henry=Hey! Henry's come to see us!
11_01_Hynek_V_Henry2=Have you found the sword yet?
11_01_HenryOfSkalitz_V_Henry=And you, have you quit drinking, Hynek?
11_01_Hynek_V_Henry3=(laughter) All right, all right… You win!
11_01_HenryOfSkalitz_V_Henry2=I feel quite hungry.
11_01_Hynek_V_Henry4=Go talk to Robby over there. I'm sure he'll find some porridge for you.
11_01_HenryOfSkalitz_V_Henry3=Thank you. I knew you'd point me in the right direction.
11_01_Earthworm=Earthworm
11_01_Earthworm4=Earthworm
11_01_Hook=Fishing hook
11_01_Fish=Fish
11_01_Fish4=Fish

11_01_Hynek_V_Puchala_Intro=Jesus Christ be praised, Dobeslav.
11_01_DobesPuchala_V_Intro=(grunt)
11_01_Hynek_V_Puchala_Silence=…
11_01_DobesPuchala_V_Silence=…
11_01_Hynek_V_Puchala_Making=What are you making?
11_01_DobesPuchala_V_Making=It's Lent. I'm sick of porridge. I'm making some fish hooks for myself.
11_01_Hynek_V_Puchala_Bye=I'll be going again.
11_01_DobesPuchala_V_Bye=(grunt)
11_01_Hynek_V_Puchala_Mood=The mood you're in today, Dobeslav!
11_01_DobesPuchala_V_Mood=(grunt)
11_01_DobesPuchala_V_TryTakeHook=Hey, don't touch! One more time and I'll break that stealing claw of yours!
11_01_Hynek_V_Dice=I need dice. You wouldn't happen to have any?
11_01_DobesPuchala_V_Dice=Give me a break, I'm going fishing.
11_01_Hynek_V_DiceDivis=Father, I need dice. Do you know of any?
11_01_Divis_V_Dice=Pray the Lord's Prayer to get rid of those sinful thoughts, Hynek!
11_01_Hynek_V_DiceDivis2=Yes, yes… Sure! What was I thinking?
11_01_Slama_V_Dice=You know how it went last time. I got rid of the dice so they wouldn't tempt me.
11_01_Slama_V_Dice2=I only kept the loaded one, I was sorry to throw away all the work I'd put into it.
11_01_Hynek_V_Slama_CheatDice=How does your loaded die work?
11_01_Slama_V_CheatDice=It works great! It rolls a one whenever you cast it. If you count on that, you can't lose!
11_01_Hynek_V_Slama_CheatDiceBorrow=Can I borrow that die?
11_01_Slama_V_CheatDiceBorrow=Here… Take it.
11_01_Pribik_V_Dice=First drunkenness and now gambling? Hynek, Hynek…
11_01_Pribik_V_Dice2=I could find some… But it won't be for free.
11_01_Hynek_V_Pribik_Dice_Ducat=I'll give you a ducat for them.
11_01_Pribik_V_Dice_Ducat=I don't want money.
11_01_Pribik_V_Dice_Fish=It's Lent and I'm craving fish. Bring me some fish and I'll lend you the dice.
11_01_Hynek_V_Pribik_Dice_Friend=Lend them to me, out of old friendship.
11_01_Pribik_V_Dice_Friend=(laughter) Will you do something for me too, out of old friendship?
11_01_Hynek_V_Pribik_Dice_Greed=Greed is a sin!
11_01_Pribik_V_Dice_Greed=And gambling is not? (laughter)
11_01_Pribik_V_Dice_Greed2=I'm not greedy, I don't want money.
11_01_Hynek_V_Fish=I need a fish. Do you have any?
11_01_Hynek_V_SlamaFish=I need a fish. Do you have any?
11_01_DobesPuchala_V_Fish=I'm going fishing right now, but I'll be fishing for myself and my people.
11_01_DobesPuchala_V_Fish2=You and your friends won't get any from me. I've seen you fraternizing with Robby.
11_01_DobesPuchala_V_Fish3=I wouldn't have shat myself because of the spoiled wine the other day if he was doing his job right. Have some porridge!
11_01_Hynek_V_DivisFish=Father, I need a fish. Do you know where to get some?
11_01_Divis_V_Fish=Beg the Lord to let your appetite for delicacies pass, Hynek!
11_01_Divis_V_Fish2=Feed your soul with prayer, not your stomach with fish.
11_01_Slama_V_Fish=Not yet, but it's crossed my mind too… I'd like some…
11_01_Slama_V_Fish2=But the thing is, the blacksmith gave all the fish hooks to Puchala and he won't lend me one.
11_01_Slama_V_Fish3=Bring a hook and a rope and I'll catch you as many fish as you want…
11_01_Slama_V_Fish4=Oh, and don't forget the earthworms!
11_01_Hynek_V_Slama_Earthworm=Listen, Straw, do you know where I can find some of those earthworms?
11_01_Slama_V_Earthworm=Well… In the dirt, you know. In the damp, too… You might find some under the rocks.
11_01_Hynek_V_Puchala_Hook=I need a fish hook. Can't you give me one?
11_01_DobesPuchala_V_Hook=I need them for myself! Give me a break already.
11_01_Hynek_V_Divis_Hook=Father, I need a fish hook. Do you have one?
11_01_Divis_V_Hook=(sigh)
11_01_Hynek_V_DivisHook2=Oh well.
11_01_Hynek_V_Pribik_Hook=I need a fish hook. Do you have one?
11_01_Pribik_V_Hook=I'd catch my own fish if I had a hook, but Puchala has all the hooks I know of, and he's angry with me.
11_01_Pribik_V_Hook2=If I find out who put the orange potion in the wine that day, I'll tell on them to Puchala and I'll have a fish right away…
11_01_Hynek_V_Pribik_Hook2=Forget it! I'll figure it out.
11_01_Slama_V_PassEarthwormInsufficient=Hmm… It takes at least three. Bring more.
11_01_Slama_V_PassEarthworm=Look how plump they are! The fish will dash for them like wasps for honey…
11_01_Slama_V_PassRope=The rope. Well done…
11_01_Slama_V_PassHook=The hook! How did you get it? … I'd better not ask.
11_01_Slama_V_AllFinished=Now I have everything I need. I'll set it up and get started. Come see me later.
11_01_Slama_V_FishReady=Hynek! There's your fish. Now I'm gonna catch another one for the lads.
11_01_Hynek_V_FishReady=Thank you, my friend!
11_01_Pribik_V_FishReady=Oh! Thank you, Hynek! Lent is about to get a lot merrier! Here are the dice. And don't you get caught with them.
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Farkle=Kolda, my friend, how about relieving your worries over a game of Farkle?
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Farkle=Don't yell so much, or someone hears us and we're in trouble.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Farkle2=Do you have dice?
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Farkle2=I do, and that crusader Lothar has the means to get you the Sobath keep and all rights that it entails. That'll pay off my old debt.
11_01_JohnKolda_V_Farkle3=Okay, what are we playing for?
11_01_Hynek_V_Kolda_Farkle3=For him. For Lothar.
11_01_GameOverFarkle=You lost Lothar at Farkle
11_01_Hynek_V_Mass=The Mass begins…
11_01_Divis_V_Mass=The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
11_01_Hynek_V_MassGod=And with your spirit.
11_01_Hussite1_V_MassGod=And with your spirit.
11_01_Hussite2_V_MassGod=And with your spirit.

11_01_DobesPuchala_V_MassGod=And with your spirit.
11_01_Pribik_V_MassGod=And with your spirit.
11_01_Divis_V_Mass2=Blessed be the name of God’s glorious kingdom forever and ever.
11_01_Divis_V_Mass3=O Lord, open our lips and our mouth shall proclaim your praise.
11_01_Divis_V_Mass4=O Lord, according to your faithful love, according to your judgement give us life.
11_02_Cut=<b>Tuesday, April 6, 1428</b><br>Foothills of Silesa Mountain, near the keep of Sobath<br>about 4 miles to Wrocław, Silesia
11_02_CutAccessibility=Lothar rides his horse side by side with Hynek in a cavalcade of Hussite troops.
11_02_CutAccessibility2=Suddenly the Hussites begin to stop.
11_02_AccessibilityLevelDescription=You are on a broad road. There are only trees all around, with Silesa Mountain towering above.
11_02_Hynek_V_ArmyStops=What's going on? Why we stopping?
11_02_Hynek_V_ProkopSobath=What happened, Prokop?
11_02_ProkopHoly_V_ProkopSobath=We're waiting for Kolda…
11_02_ProkopHoly_V_ProkopSobath2=The keep should have been empty, but it's guarded by some strange beast. It's already killed a dozen of our men.
11_02_ProkopHoly_V_ProkopSobath3=Kolda sent for the cannons. He wants to blow up the keep.
11_02_Lothar_V_ProkopSobath=Hynek, they'll kill Anna too!
11_02_Hynek_V_ProkopSobath2=Anna may not be there at all.
11_02_Lothar_V_ProkopSobath2=Don't you ever want to sleep again?
11_02_Hynek_V_ProkopSobath3=Prokop, let me and Lothar go in there, we'll deal with it.
11_02_ProkopHoly_V_ProkopSobath4=No way! It's already cost me a dozen good warriors!
11_02_Hynek_V_ProkopSobath4=Lothar knows the area and has been to the keep before.
11_02_Lothar_V_ProkopSobath3=I have no idea where we are, and I've never even seen the keep from a distance!
11_02_Hynek_V_ProkopSobath5=Shout it.
11_02_Hynek_V_ProkopSobath6=We'll finish this creature together.
11_02_ProkopHoly_V_ProkopSobath5=Ah… Hynek… What am I gonna to do with you… All right, go.
11_02_ProkopHoly_V_ProkopSobath6=But you're leaving the horses here. I trust you, but if the crusader decides to flee, he'll do so on foot. He hasn't earned his horse yet.
11_02_Hynek_V_ProkopSobath7=I give you my word of honor for both of us that we'll be back.
11_02_Hynek_V_Horses=Dismount, Lothar. We'll proceed on foot.
11_02_JohnKolda_V_AtTheGate=Hynek! What are you doing here?
11_02_Hynek_V_AtTheGate=Prokop has agreed for me and Lothar to help you deal with the situation at the keep.
11_02_Hynek_V_AtTheGate2=We will face the beast.
11_02_JohnKolda_V_AtTheGate2=No need for that, I'll blow the keep to smithereens! The fucker will peg out in the rubble.
11_02_Lothar_V_AtTheGate=And my sister too! Hynek, do something!
11_02_Hynek_V_AtTheGate3=Do you know how many innocent souls that beast might be keeping prisoner in there?
11_02_JohnKolda_V_AtTheGate3=It's cost me a dozen men, blowing up the keep is the lesser of two evils.
11_02_Hynek_V_AtTheGate4=But you're not the butcher of Blaviken!
11_02_Lothar_V_AtTheGate2=I promised the keep would be yours. Do you want to rule over ruins?
11_02_JohnKolda_V_AtTheGate4=(grunt) Very well…
11_02_JohnKolda_V_AtTheGate5=I'm giving you time until sunset. Then fuck the deal and let the cannons have their say.
11_02_JohnKolda_V_AtTheGate6=I'll build myself a new keep on your corpses. I doubt you two could do what my dozen experienced men couldn't.
11_02_Hynek_V_Basilisk=Don't look it in the eye! It's a basilisk!
11_02_Lothar_V_Basilisk=What? There's no such thing as a basilisk!
11_02_Hynek_V_Basilisk2=You can tell it that, but don't fucking look it in the eye! You'd be petrified!
11_02_Lothar_V_Basilisk2=Anything else I should know?
11_02_Hynek_V_Basilisk3=It spits poison!
11_02_Lothar_V_Basilisk3=God with us!
11_02_BasiliskGameOver=You're petrified
11_02_Hynek_V_GateLocked=The gate is secured from the other side…
11_02_Hynek_V_BasiliskDead=It looks dead!
11_02_Lothar_V_BasiliskDead=Now we have to get to the tower… and find Anna!
11_02_Hynek_V_BasiliskDead2=She could have warned me about the basilisk, too.
11_02_Hynek_V_Kolda_BasiliskDead=Kolda! The beast is dead.
11_02_JohnKolda_V_BasiliskDead=I don't know how such a pair of weaklings did it.
11_02_JohnKolda_V_BasiliskDead2=Was God with you, or did you give your souls to the Devil?
11_02_Hynek_V_Kolda_BasiliskDead2=I believe it's the former. The keep is yours, just let us search it first.
11_02_JohnKolda_V_BasiliskDead3=I keep my word. Do what you need to do.
11_02_Hynek_V_BatteringRam=Kolda!
11_02_Hynek_V_BatteringRam2=The inner gate is secured from the other side. We could use a little help.
11_02_AccessibilityBatteringRamCut=A group of Hussites have brought a battering ram to the gate and started pounding on it.
11_02_JohnKolda_V_BatteringRam=Guys! Take the battering ram and go with Hynek! The danger has passed, but we need to break through the other gate!
11_02_Hussite_V_BatteringRam=As you wish, brother Kolda!
11_02_Hussite_V_BatteringRam2=Hey! You, you and you three, with me!
11_02_Hussite_V_AfterRam=Good job, boys!
11_02_Hussite_V_AfterRam2=All right, brother Hynek! Shall we go to the tower with you?
11_02_Hynek_V_AfterRam=No, thanks. We'll be fine now.
11_02_Hynek_V_TowerBridge=Dammit. The bridge is down. We'll have to figure something out.
11_02_Hynek_V_TowerBridge2=One slab is not enough. We need at least two.
11_02_Hynek_V_TowerBridge3=That's it.
11_02_AccessibilityLevelDescription2=A narrow path leads past a wooden palisade to the gate of the small keep. It is blocked by one of the wagons. The Hussites, led by John Kolda, are gathered in front of the keep. Several cannons are aimed directly at the gate.
11_02_AccessibilityLevelDescription3=A narrow path leads past a wooden palisade to the gate of the small keep. The Hussites, led by John Kolda, are gathered in front of the keep. Several cannons are aimed directly at the gate.
11_02_AccessibilityDescriptionFirstCourtyard=You are in the courtyard of the small wooden keep, where you see about a dozen dead or petrified Hussites. A few outbuildings and a well are scattered near the palisade.
11_02_AccessibilityDescriptionSecondCourtyard=You are in the inner courtyard of the small wooden keep, near a tall tower.
11_02_AccessibilityWagonQuest=Unblock the gate
11_02_AccessibilityMarker1=First gate
11_02_AccessibilityMarker2=Second gate
11_02_AccessibilityMarker3=Tower
11_02_AccessibilityMarkerStable=Horse shelter
11_02_AccessibilityDescriptionTowerBridge=You have climbed the wooden staircase and are standing just a few fathoms from the door to the tower. Only there's no bridge. There's a hole right in front of you and you can't go any further.
11_02_AccessibilityDescriptionTowerBridge2=You have climbed the wooden staircase and are standing just a few fathoms from the door to the tower. Only there's no bridge. There's a hole right in front of you and there's a narrow slab placed across it, but it won't hold your weight.
11_03_AccessibilityMarker0=Ground floor of the tower
11_03_AccessibilityMarker1=First floor
11_03_AccessibilityMarker2=Second floor
11_03_AccessibilityDescriptionFloor0=You are on the ground floor of the wooden tower. The front door is broken and lying on the floor. There is minimal light coming in through the entrance. You see a large oak table as well as shelves and crates with supplies. In the northwest corner of the room is a spiral staircase.
11_03_AccessibilityDescriptionFloor1=You are on the first floor of the tower. Although there are windows in the room, they all have shutters closed, so the only light comes from the small metal stove in the northeast corner. The walls are lined with empty shelves, like bookshelves, but there are no books to be seen anywhere, only embossed markings on their covers. There are dishes, uneaten food and overall clutter all around.
11_03_AccessibilityDescriptionFloor2=You are in the hallway on the second floor of the tower. There is nothing here but stairs and clutter.
11_03_AccessibilityDescriptionFloor2Room=You are in a study with a variety of carefully arranged alchemical tools. They differ from the ones you've seen before in that each item has a marking on it. Adjoining the study is a small cell, which can be seen through a tiny opening in the massive door. There's a candle burning in there.
11_03_Lothar_V_Darkness=It's dark everywhere. Not even a candle burning.
11_03_Hynek_V_CellarHatch=Not now. First the tower, and if we don't find anything, we can search the basement as well.
11_03_Clairvoyant_V_Clairvoyant=So you have come…
11_03_Clairvoyant_V_Clairvoyant2=I was hoping so. Though nothing in my life has ever been so uncertain.
11_03_Hynek_V_Clairvoyant=Who are you?
11_03_Lothar_V_Clairvoyant=And where's Anna?
11_03_Clairvoyant_V_Clairvoyant3=You three were a great unknown to me. I'm used to not being surprised and knowing everything. To knowing all the endings.
11_03_Clairvoyant_V_Clairvoyant4=She grew on me… And in the end, it was she who revealed my own ending to me.
11_03_Clairvoyant_V_Clairvoyant5=You don't have to worry, you'll get what you're coming for, but I'm no longer needed here…
11_03_Clairvoyant_V_Clairvoyant6=See you in Hell…
11_03_Hynek_V_ClairvoyantDead=He's dead.
11_03_Hynek_V_ClairvoyantDeadSearch=…
11_03_Hynek_V_Globus=The old man must have had crazy visions. I've seen a lot of maps, but this one is kind of weird.
11_03_Hynek_V_Globus2=This is Rome and this is Constantinople. And this must be India. But what is this landmass expanding to the west?
11_03_Hynek_V_Globus3=Who knows on what basis he had it made for him?
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion=Hynek, Lothar!
11_03_Lothar_V_Reunion=Anna! Hold on. We'll get you out fast!
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion2=Brothers!
11_03_Hynek_V_Reunion=You mean brother.
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion3=God meant for us to find you again, Hynek. He brought you to us.
11_03_Lothar_V_Reunion2=You mean…?
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion4=Hynek is our lost brother. Granny kidnapped him when our father got angry with her.
11_03_Hynek_V_Reunion2=…
11_03_Lothar_V_Reunion3=…
11_03_Lothar_V_Reunion4=How did you find out?
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion5=Everything that happened to me awakened the gift I inherited from my ancestors. The Clairvoyant helped me learn to control it and develop it further. He's probably dead by now, right?
11_03_Hynek_V_Reunion3=How…
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion6=He was a prisoner here, almost like me. Lilith had abused him his whole life and watched his every move.
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion7=The beast in the courtyard wouldn't let anyone in, but neither out.
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion8=Lilith could talk to the Clairvoyant in her mind like I can talk to you, Hynek. She could also follow any of the humans with his blind eyes, just not the three of us.
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion9=Our Premyslid blood mixed with witch blood protects us.
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion10=The Clairvoyant decided to defy Lilith…
11_03_Hynek_V_Reunion4=That's why he killed himself, to escape the demoness's power. Fool, we could have saved him too.
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion11=It was the only way. He had to get to Hell before she did. But first, he wanted to make sure you'd come for me.
11_03_Lothar_V_Reunion5=I can't believe that Hynek… That you're really our brother.
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion12=We still have a lot to tell each other. There will be time for everything later. But right now there are matters that cannot wait.
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion13=Hynek, I must speak immediately with Prokop the Shaven, your hetman.
11_03_Hynek_V_Reunion5=What about?
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion14=Lothar, go to the top floor. There you'll find a small ornate chest containing invisibility potions under a plank in the floor, on the eastern edge of the room. They're very important to our upcoming plan.
11_03_Lothar_V_Reunion6=But…
11_03_Anna_V_Reunion15=Trust me, brothers. Please. Lothar, go! Hynek, you take me to Prokop.
11_04_AccessibilityProkopCut=Anna heads for the commander's tent at a brisk walk, Hynek barely keeping up with her.
11_04_AccessibilityProkopCut2=Dobeslav Puchala blocked her path and drew his weapon.
11_04_AccessibilityProkopCut3=Puchala stepped aside.
11_04_AccessibilityProkopCut4=Straw came and stood nearby.
11_04_AccessibilityProkopCut5=Lothar joined the group.
11_04_Anna_V_AnnaPart1=Prokop!
11_04_Hynek_V_AnnaPart1=Anna, wait…
11_04_Hynek_V_AnnaPart1_2=Anna! You can't just…
11_04_Anna_V_AnnaPart1_2=Prokop!
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart1_2=What the hell…
11_04_DobesPuchala_V_AnnaPart2=Not another step, maiden!
11_04_Hynek_V_AnnaPart2=Fuck, don't be stupid, put it away!
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart2=Hush, Dobeslav!
11_04_Hynek_V_AnnaPart2_2=Prokop, I…
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart2_2=Silence, Hynek. Who are you and why did you come to me?
11_04_Anna_V_AnnaPart2=The voice of God told me that if I stood before you, you would hear me out.
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart2_3=Speak.
11_04_Anna_V_AnnaPart3=Prokop, whom they call the Shaven. And the rest of you!
11_04_Anna_V_AnnaPart3_2=Hear what the Lord, in whose name I am here to call you to arms, has revealed to me.
11_04_Anna_V_AnnaPart3_3=The Devil is rising up on his hind legs, plotting mighty schemes against God, to which human littleness testifies.
11_04_Anna_V_AnnaPart3_4=The gates of Hell are about to open and unleash upon the world an army of the undead, demons, and hellish creatures.
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart3=What are you talking about?
11_04_Anna_V_AnnaPart3_5=We need to join forces against an enemy that not only yearns our deaths, but above all our souls.
11_04_Anna_V_AnnaPart3_6=Your soul overflows with faith, Prokop the Shaven, you are a humble servant of God. The time has come for you to earn a new epithet.
11_04_Anna_V_AnnaPart3_7=Make a truce with the Silesian lords and lead your army to Devil's Mountain near Jawor. That's where the raids will begin and where the ultimate battle will take place!
11_04_DobesPuchala_V_AnnaPart3=What are you babbling about, fool?
11_04_Divis_V_AnnaPart3=Silence, you filthy face, through the mouth of that maiden God's plans are being revealed to us!
11_04_DobesPuchala_V_AnnaPart3_2=(grunt)
11_04_Anna_V_AnnaPart4=Hear the prophecy which the Savior has revealed to me. If you obey me, but only then, we shall win. You shall be called Prokop the Great from then on.
11_04_Anna_V_AnnaPart4_2=Me and my brother Lothar shall bring reinforcements from Wrocław. I can convince the bishop and the others to join us and fight side by side. For everyone whose heart is aflame with the flame of the Lord shall hasten to take up arms in His name.
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart4=John Kolda, do you have any word from the scouts as to what's going on around Jawor?
11_04_JohnKolda_V_AnnaPart4=My scouts have been reporting strange things for days, and some have not returned at all.
11_04_JohnKolda_V_AnnaPart4_2=Something's up! I smell it in the air.
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart4_2=…
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart4_3=I don't easily believe anyone who claims the voice of God is speaking to him. But there is too much at stake.
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart4_4=When two fight, the third one laughs. The Church has turned away from God, perhaps encouraging the Devil to stick out his claws.
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart4_5=If it is God's will, we shall ride towards Jawor and make a truce with the bishop.
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart4_6=If you're just mad and making stuff up, we'll lose a week, maybe two.
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart4_7=But if what you say is true, we must help God's intentions…
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart4_8=Maybe the impending doom is a harbinger of a new beginning. Maybe that's what we've been waiting for and fighting for.
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart4_9=We shall drive out the evil and perhaps the Church shall see reason… and give ear to the truth and the four articles.
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart4_10=Does anyone have anything to say? Or is there any opposition?
11_04_All_V_AnnaPart4_Silence=…
11_04_ProkopHoly_V_AnnaPart4_11=It's decided. Ride to Wrocław, maiden. We'll wait before Devil's Mountain for the reinforcements you bring.
11_04_LotharLeavingCut=Morning, the next day
11_04_AccessibilityLotharLeavingCut=Lothar and Anna sit on a single horse and bid farewell to Hynek.
11_04_Hynek_V_LotharLeaving=What a night it was, I slept like a corpse.
11_04_Hynek_V_LotharLeaving2=It is not said in vain that the sweetest thing in the world is a fair sleep.
11_04_Anna_V_LotharLeaving=Believe me, Hynek, I couldn't do any different than to call you in your dreams.
11_04_Anna_V_LotharLeaving2=Lothar did not hear my calling, his faith is too strong and protects him even from my magic.
11_04_Anna_V_LotharLeaving3=But faith protects no one from what Lilith is planning.
11_04_Hynek_V_LotharLeaving4=Take care. Keep an eye on that scoundrel for me, Anna!
11_04_Anna_V_LotharLeaving4=Don't worry!
11_04_Lothar_V_LotharLeaving=Why are you suddenly so worried?
11_04_Hynek_V_LotharLeaving5=Lothar, death is the other blade of the two-edged sword…
11_04_Lothar_V_LotharLeaving2=…I am the first blade, brother.
11_04_Lothar_V_LotharLeaving3=Meet me at Devil's Mountain. God be with you.
11_04_Hynek_V_LotharLeaving6=Farewell.

// 12_LastBattle
12_LastBattle=The Last Battle
12_LastBattle_Battlefield=Get to the battle site and find Hynek in time

12_03_Cut=<b>Monday, April 19, 1428</b><br>On the road to Devil's Mountain, near Jawor, Silesia<br>Three hours after noon
12_03_CutAccessibility=A long line of Hospitaller knights, Silesian noblemen and their armor bearers is moving along a forest path. Lothar is riding his horse next to Prior Rupert.
12_03_CutAccessibility2=It gets dark suddenly, a strange red haze engulfs the area.
12_03_AccessibilityDescription1=You are on a narrow forest path, you can see the Hussite wagon fort far ahead in the distance. The red haze has engulfed the area and covered the sun.
12_03_AccessibilityDescription2=Blood has stained the dirt around, dead bodies and decayed skeletons of the undead are lying everywhere. You are right at the Hussite wagon fort. You see that it's broken in several places, and some of the wagons are even overturned on their sides. The red haze has engulfed the area and covered the sun.
12_03_AccessibilityDescription3=You are in a meadow among the hills. To the northwest, you see the entrance to the cave where the undead have emerged. On the other side is the wagon fort and the heat of battle. You and Hynek are invisible thanks to the potion.
12_03_Lothar_V_Intro=We are not far now. Maybe less than a mile…
12_03_Ruprecht_V_Intro=If you'd told me before Nysa that I'd ride out with the knights to help the Hussites in their fight…
12_03_Ruprecht_V_Intro2=I would have thought you a fool and wouldn't even let you join the battle.
12_03_Lothar_V_Intro2=It's been so long… It seems like forever.
12_03_Ruprecht_V_Intro3=My memories have not faded. You are the most loyal of the loyal, Lothar. You saved my life.
12_03_Ruprecht_V_Intro4=For the first time, when you got me out of the Hussite ambush…
12_03_Ruprecht_V_Intro5=…and for the second time, in the streets of the city, where that demon in a child's body lured us into the trap.
12_03_Lothar_V_Intro3=I'm afraid I was the one Lilith sent this one against. It put you in danger needlessly.
12_03_Ruprecht_V_Intro6=No, Lothar, I am the Lord's servant and must fight for his cause.
12_03_Ruprecht_V_Intro7=Anyone who opposes God is my enemy. The Hussites are fools, but they are people, and their souls matter to our Lord.
12_03_Ruprecht_V_Intro8=We will face Hell together with them, and God willing, we will then take up arms against each other no more, but…
12_03_Lothar_V_Intro4=What's going on?
12_03_Ruprecht_V_Intro9=God be with us, the Beast is coming…
12_03_Lothar_V_BattleBegunWrongWay=Not that way! I have to catch up to Hynek quickly, and he's elsewhere.
12_03_Lothar_V_BattleBegun=The battle has begun! I must find Hynek! I have important news for him from Anna…
12_03_Ruprecht_V_BattleBegun=Go! You know best where you're needed. God is your shield!
12_03_Lothar_V_BattleBegun2=Hyah!
12_03_Ruprecht_V_BattleBegun2=Get ready for fight! The enemy is coming to face us.
12_03_CutAccessibility3=Lothar rode all the way up to the wagon fort, where he dismounted. The undead are everywhere, innumerable. The Hussites are fighting an unequal battle.
12_03_Lothar_V_SearchingHynek=God! It wasn't supposed to be like this…
12_03_Lothar_V_SearchingHynek2=Hynek! Hynek!
12_03_Lothar_V_SearchingHynek3=Hynek! Hynek! I can't see him anywhere. I have to go on!
12_03_Lothar_V_SearchingHynek4=Hynek! Where could he be?!
12_03_Lothar_V_Found=Hynek! There you are!
12_03_Hynek_V_Found=Lothar! I knew you'd come!
12_03_Lothar_V_Found2=I'm not alone. The Knights of Saint John and several thousand men have come with me. They're already joining the battle!
12_03_Hynek_V_Found2=That won't be enough! The enemy surge is not ceasing, and the undead won't tire in battle. It's hard to defeat them.
12_03_Hynek_V_Found3=More and more cursed souls are pouring in from the cave to the west.
12_03_Lothar_V_Found3=That's exactly where we need to go… to stop them right at their place of origin.
12_03_Hynek_V_Found4=Have you gone mad? We can't get there. There are too many enemies between us and the gate. We're not gonna make it!
12_03_Lothar_V_Found4=Anna gave me precise instructions on how to proceed. We don't have to break through.
12_03_Lothar_V_Found5=With the help of the Clairvoyant's invisibility potion, we'll get through easily.
12_03_Lothar_V_InvisibilityPotion=Here you go. Drink this… I'll tell you everything as we go.
12_03_AccessibilityInvisibility=You and Hynek are now invisible.
12_03_Lothar_V_CaveWrongWay=Not that way. We have to get in the cave! Quickly, before the invisibility potion wears off.
12_03_Lothar_V_WayToCave=We must go to Hell. Just you and me, no one else. Otherwise, all our efforts are in vain!
12_03_Hynek_V_WayToCave=To Hell? What happened?
12_03_Lothar_V_WayToCave2=The Clairvoyant took his own life, so he could reveal to the Devil himself everything Lilith was planning.
12_03_Lothar_V_WayToCave3=That she is in league with John of Monsterberg and together they plan to kill him.
12_03_Lothar_V_WayToCave4=The passage in Devil's Mountain was opened just so that John could enter with the Spear of Destiny.
12_03_Lothar_V_WayToCave5=The Devil believes that Lilith has the Stone of God's Wrath, which she used to open all the gates of Hell on earth, and the army of darkness is now occupying it.
12_03_Hynek_V_WayToCave2=I know that, but what has changed?
12_03_Lothar_V_WayToCave6=Anna had a vision. Lilith did find the Stone.
12_03_Hynek_V_WayToCave3=How?
12_03_Lothar_V_WayToCave7=Her minions stumbled upon it almost by accident. The collapse of the Red Mine brought it to the surface!
12_03_Hynek_V_WayToCave4=Fucking stupid coincidence!
12_03_Lothar_V_WayToCave8=We must be the ones to get it! We cannot allow the remaining gates of Hell to be opened.
12_03_Lothar_V_WayToCave9=It doesn't matter who does it, Lilith and John, or the Devil. Humanity would be done either way!
12_03_Hynek_V_WayToCave5=Oh, fuck me running. And why should we be the ones to fix it?
12_03_Lothar_V_WayToCave10=No one else will do it.
12_03_Hynek_V_WayToCave6=Well, that makes me really pleased. Where are the Knights of the Round Table when we need them most?
12_03_Lothar_V_WayToCave11=Who?
12_03_Hynek_V_WayToCave7=Oh… Never mind.
12_03_CutAccessibility4=The two brothers have reached the cave entrance.
12_03_Lothar_V_CaveEntrance=Commend your spirit to God here, because where we're going, He has only a trickle of power.
12_03_Hynek_V_CaveEntrance=I'm not afraid! I'd be a pretty tough mouthful even for Hell to swallow.
12_03_Lothar_V_CaveEntrance2=In the name of our Lord! Let's go, brother!
12_03_InvisibilityPotion=Invisibility potion
12_04_AccessibilityLevelDescription=You are in a dark, dank cave. You can smell brimstone all around you.
12_04_AccessibilityDescription1=There is a deep abyss in the middle of the spacious area, across which a rope bridge should be placed.
12_04_AccessibilityDescription2=The way ahead is blocked by sharp metal spikes with skulls impaled on them. Where did these come from?
12_04_AccessibilityDescription3=The narrow corridor led into an open area. On one side, three naked girls are lying by the wall and lewdly puckering their bosoms at the two of you.
12_04_AccessibilityDescription4=The narrow corridor led into an open area. By one of the walls, there are thousands of ducats, expensive jewellery, dishes, and also several richly decorated chests lying on the rock.
12_04_AccessibilityDescription5=The corridor led you to the end, to a large space where there is a huge stone gate. It's all glowing like it's burning, but it's not fire. There's a hot breeze coming out of it, heating the whole area uncomfortably. On the ground, there is a pentagram, a dead girl, a man, and also a horse.
12_04_AccessibilityDescription6=The wall ahead of you makes it obvious that you've reached the end. There is no path leading onwards.

12_04_Lilith_V_HellGate=You killed my Clairvoyant! And you stole my virgin!
12_04_Lothar_V_HellGate=We had nothing to do with the Clairvoyant's death.
12_04_Hynek_V_HellGate=And you should have guarded your own virginity!
12_04_JohnMonsterberg_V_HellGate2=Catch them, torture them, kill them! Now!
12_04_Lothar_V_HellGateTooEarly=I can't leave Hynek to deal with it alone!
12_04_Hynek_V_HellGateFinal=All done. If I survive this, I'll drink myself stupid and fuck half the nearest village.
12_04_Lothar_V_HellGateFinal=Hynek, God can hear you!
12_04_Hynek_V_HellGateFinal2=Not here, but he'll see it if I survive.
12_04_Lothar_V_HellGateFinal2=You are my brother, a nobleman!
12_04_Hynek_V_HellGateFinal3=Let's keep this to ourselves for a while, shall we? What now?

13_01_Hynek_V_Intro4=No, it's not that, it's brimstone. I'd fancy a shot of liquor, this is too much even for me.
13_01_AccessibilityDescription=You are in Hell. The inhuman heat and the smell of brimstone make it difficult for you to breathe. It's even hard to see in the hot air. Sinners are crawling on the ground, others are boiling in cauldrons, or being abused and tortured by devils.

13_02_Clairvoyant_V_ThroneOfHell_Part1_2=I don't know who's standing before you, but judging by his voice, he's not John of Monsterberg.
13_02_Clairvoyant_V_ThroneOfHell_Part1_3=How many living people could there be in your realm?
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_Part1_5=Probably more than I'd expect, by the horned Devil!

13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_Part3_Kill=You two? (laughter) The only thing that could hurt me is…
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_Part3_Kill=The Spear of Destiny.
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_Part3_Kill2=And that's being held by the man whom Lilith has entered Hell with!
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_Part3_Kill3=But you don't know one thing, Lucifer!
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_Part3_3=What, not all the gates of Hell are open?! That wretched bitch!
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_Part3_4=Wait till I clutch her with my claws…
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_Part3=Look out, behind you!
13_02_Hynek_V_ThroneOfHell_JohnMonsterberg=Speak of the devil…

13_02_JohnMonsterberg_V_ThroneOfHell=You bastards! You've spoiled everything! Argh!
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_JohnMonsterberg2=Now, now, you wanna fight it out? Well, go for it, for my entertainment!
13_02_Lilith_V_ThroneOfHell_JohnMonsterberg=No, don't do it! John!
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_JohnMonsterberg3=Blll! And the rest of you, do not interfere.
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_JohnMonsterberg=Hynek!
13_02_Hynek_V_ThroneOfHell_JohnMonsterberg2=Don't worry! I can deal with this scum!
13_02_Hynek_V_ThroneOfHell_Spear=Lothar! The Spear!
13_02_Hynek_V_ThroneOfHell_Spear2=And now kill that beast!
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_Spear=Blll.
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_Spear=And what good is that going to do? How long is the throne of Hell going to remain empty?
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_Spear2=Besides, good would lose all its glamour without evil anyway!
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_Spear3=Light needs darkness, just like day needs night.
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_Spear4=Man needs Hell, so that he may trot towards the benevolent arms of God with the way he lives.
13_02_Hynek_V_ThroneOfHell_Spear3=You idealist! What do you want to do then?
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_Spear5=Enough playing around, Lucifer! Recall your army from the surface back to Hell!
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_Spear2=Blll. Phew. I have different plans!
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_Part7_Lilith=Why are not all the gates of Hell open? Give that stone here!
13_02_Lilith_V_ThroneOfHell_Part7=Never! It belongs to me and John!
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_Part7_Lilith2=Are you defying me, you cursed bitch?!
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_Part7_Lilith3=We'll see how you're going to defy the torture of Hell!

13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_Stone=The stone!
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_Stone=It's mine! Blll! Don't touch it!

13_02_Hynek_V_ThroneOfHell_HynekStone=Go fuck yourself!
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_HynekStone2=Blll.
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_HynekStone3=You can't do anything about it! You're a sinner, and your soul is going to belong to Hell soon!
13_02_Hynek_V_ThroneOfHell_HynekStone2=No fucking way!
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_HynekStone4=I'll skin you! I'll shatter your bones!

13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_HynekStone8=Go get him! Rip him of his life and throw him in a cauldron!
13_02_LuciferGameOverReason=The Devil has seized the Stone of God's Wrath
13_02_Hynek_V_ThroneOfHell_LotharStone=Lothar, here you go! You are a pure soul, do something!
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_LotharStone=Blll! Put that stone down at my throne.
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_LotharStone=No.
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_LotharStone2=I shalt give thee everything thy heart yearns. A pile of gold, an emperor's crown, young maidens…
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_LotharStone2=None of that tempts me.
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_LotharStone3=Put that stone down at my throne.
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_LotharStone4=Get away from me, or I'll change my mind and you'll see the Spear of Destiny close up.
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_LotharStone4=Blll! Phew! As you wish!
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_LotharStone5=I'll destroy the Stone of God's Wrath and seal Hell as God meant it to be.
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_LotharStone6=I'll save all the living people in the entire world. May everyone's deeds decide where their souls go upon death.
13_02_Hynek_V_ThroneOfHell_LotharStone2=That sounds like a great plan, Lothar. Not that I'd like to ruin it, but you know how to destroy the Stone?
13_02_Lucifer_V_ThroneOfHell_LotharStone5=Go get them! Rip them of their lives and throw them in cauldrons!
13_02_Lothar_V_ThroneOfHell_LotharStone7=Have faith, brother. Something just occurred to me!
13_02_Lucifer_V_LotharPray1=Blll! Phew!
13_02_Lucifer_V_LotharPray2=The worst kind of magic! A humble prayer of a pure soul!
13_02_Lucifer_V_LotharPray3=Stop it, you holy bastard! Don't summon God in here! Yuck!
13_02_Lucifer_V_LotharPray4=Make it stop! Blll.
13_02_Lucifer_V_LotharPray5=Allright, take them, God! Have it your way! They're yours! Both of them as well as that nobody from Monsterberg!
13_02_Lucifer_V_LotharPray6=Blll!
13_02_Lothar_V_Pray1=Our Father, which art in heaven…
13_02_Lothar_V_Pray2=Hallowed be thy Name…
13_02_Lothar_V_Pray3=Thy kingdom come…
13_02_Lothar_V_Pray4=Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven…
13_02_Lothar_V_Pray5=Give us this day our daily bread…
13_02_Lothar_V_Pray6=And forgive us our debts…
13_02_Lothar_V_Pray7=As we forgive our debtors…
13_02_Lothar_V_Pray8=And lead us not into temptation…
13_02_Lothar_V_Pray9=But deliver us from evil…
13_02_Lothar_V_Pray10=For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever…
13_02_Lothar_V_PrayAmen=Amen.
13_03_Cut=<b>Saturday, May 1, 1428</b><br>The siege of Wrocław, Silesia
13_03_AccessibilityCut=Rupert is standing on the battlements, watching the Hussite army. Lothar walked out of the tower to join him.
13_03_AccessibilityCut2=Hynek is walking along the wagonfort together with Prokop.
13_03_AccessibilityCut3=Lothar walks away.
13_03_AccessibilityCut4=Hynek walks away and Prokop faces the Hussites by the cannons.
13_03_Lothar_V_First1=Prior…
13_03_Ruprecht_V_First1=Lothar! Come join me.
13_03_Ruprecht_V_First2=Look at them firing their cannons blindly. They're just trying to scare us off. They're not strong enough to storm Wrocław head on.
13_03_Lothar_V_First2=I come with a humble plea.
13_03_Lothar_V_First3=I want you to temporarily free me from the services of the order.
13_03_Ruprecht_V_First3=What? Now, in the middle of the fighting in which you've proved yourself so worthy?
13_03_Lothar_V_First4=Reichenstein has been burned down, and my sister needs me to assist her with its renewal.
13_03_Ruprecht_V_First4=Don't get angry, but she should have had a husband who would have taken care of her ages ago.
13_03_Ruprecht_V_First5=We need your abilities here, not somewhere in the woods to the south.
13_03_Ruprecht_V_First6=You are a pillar of faith, and it is your duty to stand fast to defend it with your blade.
13_03_Lothar_V_First5=Aren't you going to get angry either, Rupert, if I say that you won't find faith on the tip of the sword?
13_03_Hynek_V_Second1=I'm leaving. I won't be heading to Bohemia with you.
13_03_ProkopHoly_V_Second1=What's gotten into you?
13_03_Hynek_V_Second2=I'm not a callow youth anymore, and I won't probably live long enough to grow gray hair. I'd like to settle down.
13_03_ProkopHoly_V_Second2=You? (laughter) You can't be serious.
13_03_Hynek_V_Second3=You would have understood me if the destruction of the Stone of God's Wrath hadn't taken away your memory.
13_03_ProkopHoly_V_Second3=The destruction of what? Hynek, you've been drinking again!
13_03_Hynek_V_Second4=Not a sip, Prokop. I just saw and experienced more than you'd have believed, and more than should have been possible in one life time.
13_03_ProkopHoly_V_Second4=And what about our cause?
13_03_Hynek_V_Second5=Fuck the cause! Do you seriously think that if we kill off one another in God's name, the last one standing will be the one who's right?
13_03_Hynek_V_Second6=Hell no! It's gonna be the one who knows how to brandish his sword or mace best.
13_03_Lothar_V_Third1=You have to find faith in your own heart.
13_03_Lothar_V_Third2=To serve the Lord humbly and kindly. To care for the good of your fellows, as well as that of your own.
13_03_Lothar_V_Third3=Both us and the Hussites pray to the same God, and yet…
13_03_Ruprecht_V_Third1=Are you feverish, or why are you defending the heretics?
13_03_Hynek_V_Fourth1=You won't find God in war! We just trot along the path to the gates of Hell. And the Devil rejoices and laughs at our actions!
13_03_ProkopHoly_V_Fourth1=But we fight for the truth, brother!
13_03_Hynek_V_Fourth2=Violence only stems further violence.
13_03_ProkopHoly_V_Fourth2=The negotiations at the desk didn't lead anywhere!
13_03_Hynek_V_Fourth3=And were you actually trying to reach an agreement?
13_03_ProkopHoly_V_Fourth3=No agreement is possible when the words of those dimwits are being dictated by the very Devil that you're boasting about here! Or would the Church ever let Bohemia tread its own path of faith?
13_03_Ruprecht_V_Fifth1=You lost many friends in the battle of Nysa, the Hussites burned down your home, and you're still saying that…
13_03_Lothar_V_Fifth1=…that we should sit down at a desk together and reach an agreement.
13_03_Lothar_V_Fifth2=God commands us only very little, and that little is written in the Ten Commandments. One of the commandments says - thou shalt not kill.
13_03_Ruprecht_V_Fifth2=Tell that to the ones attacking us.
13_03_Lothar_V_Fifth3=Invite them to negotiate, share your bread with them, and tell it to them yourself.
13_03_Ruprecht_V_Fifth3=Lothar… Do you honestly think this is up to me? That I am the one to decide who's the enemy of the Church?
13_03_Lothar_V_Fifth4=God gave us free will. I shall serve the Lord as I have sworn, but not with a sword in my hand anymore.
13_03_Lothar_V_Fifth5=I'm going back to Reichenstein.
13_03_Ruprecht_V_Fifth4=You've lost your wits altogether!
13_03_Ruprecht_V_Fifth5=Well, be off with you then! Get lost! I don't need you!
13_03_Hynek_V_Sixth1=Put those words where your mouth is, Prokop.
13_03_ProkopHoly_V_Sixth1=Watch your tongue!
13_03_Hynek_V_Sixth2=I will, but elsewhere.
13_03_Hynek_V_Sixth3=My sister needs my aid with the renewal of her castle after the fire.
13_03_ProkopHoly_V_Sixth2=What are you babbling about, Hynek? You have no sister.
13_03_Hynek_V_Sixth4=And then I'd like to pay a visit to an old friend of mine… As much as she sucked before, I now miss her dearly.
13_03_ProkopHoly_V_Sixth3=You've probably lost your brains for good from all the booze…
